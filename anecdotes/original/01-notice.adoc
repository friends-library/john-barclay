== Notice

Many of the popular works of the present day, although generally considered innocent,
seem calculated to enervate the mind of the reader,
and indispose it for perusing the scriptures and other religious books.
The anecdotes and incidents related in this small volume are interesting,
and it is hoped, may be a means of exciting in the youthful reader,
a desire to become better acquainted with the history and doctrines of our predecessors;
as well as with the scriptures of Truth; the reading of which,
under the influence of the Spirit from which they emanated,
has a tendency to solemnize the mind,
and direct it to the source and fountain of all good,
the Spirit of Grace and Truth in the heart.

New York, 11mo. 1832.
