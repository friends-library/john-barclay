== Chapter XX.

Some observations on the state of the Society of Friends in the present day,
occasioned by the foregoing history, and the anticipations of their predecessors.

At the opening of these Memoirs, the travels of George Fox in Scotland, in the year 1657,
were briefly adverted to.
After describing, in his Journal, the last meeting he had,
previous to his return to England,
this extraordinary comment upon his visit occurs.--"`The
truth and the power of God was set over that nation;
and many, by the power and Spirit of God, were turned to the Lord Jesus Christ,
their Saviour and Teacher, whose blood was shed for them:
and there is since a great increase,--and great there will be in Scotland,
though the time may be far distant at present.
For when first I set my horse`'s feet upon Scottish ground,
I felt the seed of God to sparkle about me, as innumerable sparks of fire.
Not but that there is abundance of thick, cloddy earth of hypocrisy and falseness atop,
and a briary, brambly nature, which is to be burned up with God`'s word,
and ploughed up with his spiritual plough,
before God`'s seed brings forth heavenly and spiritual fruit to his glory.
But the husbandman is to wait in patience.`"

Whether those readers, who may be inclined to lay some stress upon such anticipation,
can see anything like the fulfilment of it, at least in part, in the foregoing history,
must be left with each individual to decide for himself.
Certainly, it is due to the subject to state, that George Fox was not the only one,
who deliberately avowed his views, as to the more extensive reception,
through that district, of a standard of truth and righteousness,
such as is upheld by the Society of Friends.
William Dewsbury`'s letter, in this volume,
plainly and strongly intimates his expectations on the same point;
while one from William Penn to these persecuted people,
will bear no very different construction.
In 1677, George Fox again declares his belief,
that "`the Lord has a great seed and work in that country.`"
Andrew Jaffray also,
a sketch of whose character and close formed the
principal subject of the last preceding chapter,
was another who entertained similar impressions.
In the testimony respecting him, before cited, and which, it will be recollected,
was drawn up by the son of "`the Apologist,`" these
following expressions are made use of.
"`There are several remarkable instances of his having, upon occasion,
had the gift of prophecy;--which strengthens the
desire and hope the Lord has raised in several,
in that +++[+++respect, in which]
he was very positive, namely,--that the Lord would yet again visit this land,
to the gathering of many to condemn the world, its wisdom, and ways.`"--Besides these,
John Gratton,
whose visit to his fellow-professors in Scotland has been already described,
closes his narrative with this encouraging estimate of the prospects,
as well as actual condition of religious classes
of the people at large:--"`I hope and believe,
the Lord will have a great people there, in time to come; though the enemy be angry,
and would hinder the spreading of the holy Truth; yet, his weapons are but carnal, silly,
and weak.
I desire many Friends may think of that nation, and, in the will of God,
give up to visit it; for, there is a zealous, professing people, that,
were they but brought to the knowledge of Truth--I believe there are many, yes,
very many, who would be zealous for it.`"
See his Journal, edit.
1823, p. 115. This was about the year 1694.

Doubtless, such expectations were not unreasonable; they were never entertained,
neither were such declared assurances ever given forth,
by any true messengers of the Lord,
without at least an implied reference to those qualifying conditions,
which must ever attend the distribution of the tokens of Divine favour towards any people.

But, in order somewhat further to clear up, at least so far as the Author may be enabled,
a subject deeply involving, to a certain extent,
the all-important interests of true religion--namely,
the condition and prospects of that small portion of the Christian community,
whose history has now been brought to a conclusion;
it is needful to indulge him with a little latitude,
while he attempts to relieve his mind as regards such a people,
by some remarks more especially applicable to them.

It has been abundantly, explicitly,
and publicly avowed by the early members of the Society of Friends,
that they did believe themselves raised up by the power of God,
to manifest forth "`The Truth as it is in Jesus;`" being assured, that,
in various essential points and symptoms, the professing Christians of their day,
had greatly fallen short of so purely spiritual a standard.
It was also their belief,
that if they sustained in faithfulness this testimony committed to them,
others would in due season be constrained to acknowledge its excellence,
and gather unto it.
Accordingly, as long as they followed in simplicity their Leader and Light,
obeying unreservedly that power in which their faith stood, wonderful,
even in the face of all opposition, were the effects of their example and ministry.
But, when they or their successors in any wise withdrew their necks from the yoke of Christ,
allowing anything to stand in competition with his will concerning them,
and so declining to cleave unto the Lord with full purpose of heart;
he hid his face from them, and veiled that glory,
which had indeed been a wall of defence about them, on the right hand and on the left.
Thus, in proportion as they have at any time cast away the shield of faith in this Divine,
inward power,
whereby their predecessors measurably obtained victory
over the things of a present world;
the enemy by little and little has prevailed, so as, in some respects,
to reduce them to a comparatively feeble and defective condition.
Meanwhile, among the different persuasions of Protestants in these nations,
there have been those, who,
occupying with what has been made known to them of Divine light and truth,
have grown stronger and stronger in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour,
Jesus Christ.
These have been given to see and to maintain some of those very principles and practices,
with which the people called Quakers, almost singly and alone,
seemed aforetime to have been entrusted.
Thus, in the present day, the sentiments held by others of the pious,
dedicated servants of God, beside the Friends, have undergone a considerable,
though gradual amelioration;
the standard of Truth has been more purely exalted through them,
although their respective popular creeds and ceremonial usages,
may remain much as they were in former times;
they are pressing into the marrow and pith of true
religion,--the life of Jesus inwardly revealed.
So that, as might be expected, many such are actually, at this day,
approving and accepting those very decrees, and ordinances, and testimonies,
which the Spirit of Christ, the Truth,
led our forefathers to adopt or observe;--and which testimonies, nevertheless,
are even now, by our own professed friends, oftentimes let fall in our streets,
and in some danger of being trampled under foot.

What wonder, then, that this precious discovery of spiritual doctrine and practice,
did not prevail among the nations, in that manner and to the full extent,
which we may imagine the primitive Friends expected?
Yes, rather, is there not cause of wonder,
that it should have been thus far admired and owned by others,
so palpable occasion of stumbling having been, from one generation to another,
administered within our own borders?
And how would it have flourished in the earth,
had this people more generally abode in the Vine of Life,
as the true spiritual Israel ever do!
The Lord would have kept these fruitful branches, as his Prophet declares,
"`night and day,`"--he would have watered them "`every moment:`" then also,
his ancient promise, in the succeeding verses,
would have been amply realized--"`He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root:
Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the earth with fruit.`" Isa. 27:3,6.
But,
still more is the infinite long-suffering and unsearchable
forbearance of the Almighty to be adored,
that such a people as this, should not have been even utterly "`cut short`" and forsaken;
according to those memorable denunciations and threats
made use of in Holy Scripture against outward Israel,
a backsliding and rebellious generation,--according, also, to those prophetic warnings,
which from time to time, and of late, even year by year,
have gone forth from the lips of chosen vessels in the midst of our public assemblies.
Truly, "`it is of the Lord`'s mercies +++[+++that]
we,`" whose responsibilities have been so great, "`are not consumed!`"

Congenial with the above views of the justice and mercy of the Most High,
is the pathetic language adopted by one of such faithful gospel ministers, who,
in comparatively recent times, visited the Friends in Scotland,
from the continent of America.
"`Although,`" says J. Churchman, "`the descendants and children of Friends,
who were as bright stars in their day,
may value themselves on the worthiness of their parents; yet,
if they do not love and serve the God of their fathers
with a perfect heart and an upright mind,
he will not own them with his heavenly presence, but they will be as unsavoury salt.`"
See his Journal, Philad.
edit.
1818, p. 129. Again, another dedicated minister, Richard Jordan,
leaves this feeling remark on record.--"`Oh! may the lives and testimonies
of those eminent instruments and faithful servants of God in their day,
like the blood of righteous Abel, though dead,
yet continue so to speak to after generations, and to their own posterity in particular,
that they may be stirred up to follow them as they followed Christ.`"
And a little further on, he thus speaks of the state of the people more at large.
"`I may now remark, that in passing along through Scotland,
it has not felt so dark and distressing to my mind, as in many other places.
It has seemed to me, that there are many precious souls,
who are secretly inquiring the way to the Zion of rest;
but,--oh! for those pastors and teachers, who keep them, as it were,
in the outward court, and instruct them to look for this rest in something without them,
even in their ceremonies and ordinances.
But how can it be otherwise, when they themselves have come no further;
but are still framing ordinances out of the Scriptures, without the Spirit,
and without the Life.
Oh! what running to and fro, to find this rest, what divisions in their churches,
so called;--yes, divisions, and subdivisions; and none seem to be yet settled.
How my soul felt for them; and I was not a little confirmed in my mind,
that a door would be opened, yes, was already opened,
for the true messengers of the gospel to honour profitably in that country;
if they do but travail deep enough in the Spirit and Life,--which,
it is the earnest solicitude of my soul, may be the case there,
and wherever it may please the Lord to send them.`"

Thus, can we not, who belong to so highly favoured a church, most plainly perceive,
that it is disobedience and distrust,
(the one being very intimately connected with the other,)
that draw down the Divine displeasure upon a people;
in accordance with that exhortation of the Prophet in the name of his God, Jer. 7:23.
--"`Obey my voice,`" and then, continues he, "`I will be your God,
and you shall be my people`"--not else.
And says the Apostle Paul, "`Towards you,`" that is, the called of the Lord, "`goodness;
if you continue in his goodness, otherwise, you also shall be cut off,`" Rom. 11:22;
and again, another Apostle utters this awful inquiry,
"`What shall the end be of those that obey not the gospel of God?`" 1 Peter 4:17.

The Society of Friends, certainly,
never countenanced the idea among its professed members or adherents,--as
a modern writer on Ecclesiastical History and Noncomformity seems
to intimate,--that any of us should think within ourselves,
"`We have Abraham to our father.`"
The strain of exhortation may, indeed, not infrequently be heard among us,
"`Look unto Abraham your father,
and Sarah that bare you`"--"`walk in the steps of that faith of our father
Abraham`"---follow such as have themselves truly followed Christ,
have drank of that Rock,
and found it to be in them "`a well of water springing up into everlasting life.`"

Ah! may a consideration of what the Lord has wrought for the predecessors of this people,
duly affect the minds of those, who, in a certain sense,
have taken up their mantle,--who have been made sensible
what constituted the clothing of their spirits,
even the garments of righteousness, salvation, and praise!
May they often meditate upon the honourable place,
which has been obtained for them in the estimation
of other disciples of a crucified Saviour,
even through a sea of troubles, "`a fight of afflictions!`"
May they correctly appreciate the value of that description of inheritance,
in some sort procured unto them through the sufferings and exercises of those, who,
like Caleb and Joshua,
have led the way to a land of spiritual rest and plenty! may they
be encouraged to go into this good land and possess it,--more richly,
more fully, more availingly inherit it, to the health of their own souls,
and to the help of all with whom they have to do!
May those also of a younger generation, like Timothy of old,
keep that good thing committed to them, by the Holy Spirit;
then the promises and prophecies, which may have gone before on such, will be revived,
confirmed, and applied in their experience;
and the faith which was in their forefathers will also, doubtless, dwell in them.
In this way, is it not to be confidently, yet humbly expected,
that such will be "`blessed of the Lord,
and their offspring with them,`" that He will delight to increase such more and more,
they and their children; so that, instead of their fathers, will, in due season,
be the children, standing in their allotment and sharing in their privileges.
For "`the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him,
and his righteousness unto children`'s children; to such as keep his covenant,
and to those that remember his commandments to do them.`"
Ps. 103:17-18.

In contemplating the foregoing memorials of a Christian community,
so remarkably separated unto the Lord, through reception of the Truth of Christ,
and sanctification of the spirit thereby:--"`strengthened,`" also, as they were,
in proportion to their need, "`with all might according to his glorious power,
unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness,`"--will
there not an acknowledgment be raised,
in the breast of every one that knows and loves the appearing of Jesus Christ,
that such a work must be of God and not of man.
And if we are prepared to admit, it was, in their case,
by the effectual operation of his power and grace upon their hearts,
that such a work was thus commenced, carried on, and completed to his own praise;
shall we not, in like manner, be ready to believe, that thus, in our line and measure,
he is willing to do for us of the present day, as well as for every generation of those,
who shall desire above all things to "`wait for his salvation,`" who shall
be "`looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.`"
Assuredly, "`the promise`" is unto us and unto our "`children,
and unto all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call:`"--for,
"`God is faithful, by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his Son.`" 1 Cor. 1:9.

There may be those readers, who belong to the Society of Friends,
as there may be also other dedicated, but discouraged minds, who,
in taking a survey of the Lord`'s marvellous dealings with those who have preceded them,
and in reflecting on the manifold weaknesses which attend and surround them,
may be oftentimes inclined to take up the mournful expressions of the Psalmist, Ps. 77:5.
--"`I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with my own heart:
and my spirit made diligent search.
Will the Lord cast off forever?
and will he be favourable no more?
Is his mercy clean gone forever?
does his promise fail forevermore?
Has the Lord forgotten to be gracious?
has he in anger shut up his tender mercies?
Selah.
And I said, This is my infirmity;
but I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.
I will remember the works of the Lord: surely, I will remember your wonders of old.
I will meditate also of all your work, and talk of your doings.`"

But, "`Behold,`" said the evangelical Prophet, "`the Lord`'s hand is not shortened,
that it cannot save, neither his ear grown heavy, that it cannot hear`"--and,
for the cry of the poor and the sighing of the needy, he yet continues to arise,
having mercy upon Zion, and comforting all her waste places;
so that the confession is still known to break forth, season after season,
from prepared hearts,--in the language of the blessed Virgin,--"`He has showed strength
with his arm--his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.`"

Wonderful, indeed, in every age,
are the dealings of the Shepherd of Israel towards those under every name,
who are the sheep of his hand!
Wherever scattered, or wherever gathered,
truly they have "`a goodly heritage,`" as well as
"`exceeding great and precious promises;`" and,
however these provided blessings may seem for a time to fall short of fulfilment,
yet are they all in progress,
yet are they all steadfast and sure to His seed and church,--to
those who cleave unto Him in dependence and submission of soul.
A mark is said to be set upon those who sigh and cry,--who, waiting,
mourn for the accomplishment of these heavenly promises, in the further development,
purification, and glory of Zion:--their borders will be enlarged, says the Lord God!
See Isa. 54:2,3,6, and 11; also Jer. 30:15 to 19. "`For yet a little while,
and he that shall come, will come, and will not tarry;`" he will, in due season,
more fully and more unequivocally acknowledge his holy work and people,
all the world over, even those that are endeavouring, however feebly,
to acknowledge him in their ways.
The declaration has gone forth--"`You shall arise and have mercy upon Zion;
for the time to favour her, yes, the set time, is come,`" Ps. 102:13;
and verse 16,--"`When the Lord shall build up Zion, he will appear in his glory.`"
And again, it is affirmed by the Prophet,
that he will beautify the place of his sanctuary,
and will make the place of his feet glorious. Isa. 60:13.

Thus, the tribulated followers of the Lamb,
however burdened with a sense of the present triumphing of their enemies,
however bowed down in spirit when given to see the state of things around them,--if
they can adopt that language of appeal uttered by the servant of God in ancient days,
Isa. 26:8, "`In the way of your judgments, O Lord! have we waited for you;
the desire of our soul is to your name, and to the remembrance of you;`"--even all such,
may undoubtedly look forward with confidence to the completion
of what is written,--"`Yet a very little while,
and the indignation shall cease, and my anger in their destruction.`"
"`The rebuke of his people,
shall he take away from off all the earth;`" and "`it shall be said in that day,
Lo! this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us,
we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.`" Isa. 25:9.
