+++[+++Although our early Friends had sprung up and were known as a distinct
religious profession in some parts of the North of England,
previous to the year 1654, it does not appear from our historians, that they had much,
if any, appearance in the metropolis, prior to that year.
William Crouch, who resided in London at this period, informs us in his Memoirs,
that "`about the beginning of the year 1654,
some workings of the power of Truth came to be felt among
some tender people in and about the city of London;
and some few were convinced, and turned to the Lord.`"
The following letter, dated the 29th of 11th month, 1653,
is the earliest which the editor has met with, dated from London.
The writer, Gervase Benson as appears from [.book-title]#George Fox`'s Journal,#
was once a colonel in the army, he was also a justice of the peace; but in 1652,
he was convinced at Lancaster,
on the occasion of George Fox`'s attending the sessions there,
and clearing himself of the false accusations laid to his charge.
(See [.book-title]#Journal# under 1652.) Gervase Benson,
with Anthony Pearson--who also was a justice,--interested
themselves on behalf of George Fox,
when suffering imprisonment in the filthy jail of Carlisle, in 1653.
Gervase Benson is also mentioned in [.book-title]#George Fox`'s Journal,#
as a visitor at Judge Fell`'s at Swarthmore.
He died in 1679, as appears by the Westmoreland burial register of Friends,
in which he is described to be "`of Kendal.`"

Gervase Benson and Anthony Pearson being justices,
sat as magistrates "`at the Sessions at Appleby,
January 1652,`" when James Nayler was examined on his indictment
(with George Fox and Francis Howgill) upon a charge of blasphemy.
On which occasion Justice Pearson ordered their hats to be put off,
and then proceeded to question James Nayler;
it is stated "`that Justice Pearson was convinced at this Sessions by James Nayler,
as he sat on the bench, as one of his judges.`"
It is well known Anthony Pearson became the author of that approved work, [.book-title]#The Great Case of Tithes.#--[.book-title]#James Nayler`'s Works,# p. 11-16.]

To My Dearly Beloved in the Lord.

My love in the Lord salutes you, and all Friends with you.
I am by the love of God brought to this great city;
and by his power am kept here to wait upon him,
and to do whatsoever he shall call me forth unto;
that he alone may be glorified in me and by me.
Pray to the Lord for me, that I may be kept in all faithfulness;
with boldness to bear witness to the Truth,
against all deceits as they are made manifest in me,
to the praise of his free grace and love to me, which I find daily flowing into my soul,
to the refreshing thereof.

Dear Friends, I find nothing here that I can have any fellowship with:
only the Lord is raising up a light in many,--both priests and people,--that
discovers the carnal actings both of magistrates and ministers so called;
and they are carried forth publicly to declare against them.
I was lately at a meeting with some of them, at which were some Parliament men,
ministers, and others:
but I was made to declare against their practices at such meetings,
and to show them their meetings were not for the better,
but for the worse;--they spending their time in putting questions one to another,
and jangling about things they could not witness.
After we parted, I had no freedom to go to any such meetings;
but was made to write a few proposals to some members of Parliament,
which by the goodness of the Lord were finished this morning:
a copy of the heads of them I have enclosed,
not having time to write over the whole at present.

As for the Friend`'s enlargement at Kendal, George Taylor, I hope,
has or will give you an account.
Seeing nothing at present to the contrary,
but that I shall shortly see you in the country, I conclude.

[.letter-heading]
To my Dear Friend Thomas Willan, of Kendal, Westmoreland

[.signed-section-context-open]
London, 27th of Fourth month +++[+++6th month]
1654.

[.salutation]
Dear Friend,

I received your letter.
The expectations of our Friends here--who are faithful,--have been and are very great,
to have seen some Friends out of the North to come to abide here;
and they are daily looking for someone or other,
though we bless the Lord we do not so much look upon any creature:
but where there is but childishness, there can be nothing but stammerings.
The Lord still continues two of his handmaids with us, who are moved to speak sometimes;
who, aiming at their souls`' good, are often evilly entreated by them +++[+++the people;]
but they are supported by the Lord, which makes them courageous among ravenous wolves.
Others, whose hearts are not so flinty, do embrace the Truth in the love of it;
so that our number increases.
The harvest is great, the labourers few: if it be the Lord`'s will to send labourers,
we know they must come, and none can hinder.

Our present condition and temptations are exceedingly strange and great,
which require the more strict watching, and your continually praying to the Lord for us.
Sometimes the Lord moves us to speak to those that are over us in the flesh;
and though we have been as the aspen leaves, trembling at the wind before them,
yet praises be to the Lord, he gives us hearts as bold as a lion.
As it has pleased the Lord to draw us from the wicked delusions of the priests,
so likewise from those heathenish forms,
which were and are still used in the families where we live.
And though to the grief of our souls,
we cannot as yet live up in such a way as the Lord requires,
yet we are endeavouring and struggling to get mastery
over the deceit that has so long reigned in us.

The 17th day of this month,
my master in the flesh would know of me the reason
why I absented myself from his holy duties,
as he calls them.
I told him, that I had heard him in his prayers bless the Lord for his vocation,
election, redemption, and sanctification; but that he did not live up to such a life,
as those whom Christ has redeemed; neither was the Truth, as it is in Jesus, in him;
and that the prayers of the wicked are an abomination before the Lord;
and he that regards iniquity in his heart, the Lord will not hear his prayers.

When I had spoken these words to him, his face waxed pale,
and he immediately burst forth in a passion, uttering these words to me: "`You wretch,
you make me tremble--you wicked wretch--you rogue;`"
and so flying at me with his bended fists,
he smites me on the face and eyes, very often as hard as he could strike.
I not stirring hand or foot, immediately remembered the command,
"`If you are smitten on the one cheek, turn the other,`"--so I was made to do.
When he had so done, I asked him whether what he had done, were of God; his answer was,
"`No.`" So presently he commanded me to write down under my hand what I had spoken,
which I did, being scarcely able to see what I wrote for the blows he had given me.
But I was made to write that which to him seemed an aggravation to what I had spoken.

As soon as I had so done, in comes a priest,
whom my master took presently to hear this business, and to read my writing.
As soon as he had read it, says he, "`This assertion is very dubious,
and I might draw from here several questions:`" and thus he began,
"`Do you hold perfection?`"
"`Yes;--do you deny it?`"
Priest, "`Yes.`"
"`Then,`" said I, "`you are no minister of God.`"
It would be too tedious and too large to declare
to you the whole discourse between him and me;
for the promise of the Lord was made good to me at that very instant of time;
it was not I that spoke, but the Spirit of God, who was my teacher and my remembrancer.

And I declared many things to his face, how that he was no minister of God,
one who was conforming to the world in his fashions +++[+++(?) _word not clear_]
and customs: another was, that he was a hireling,
and much more which I have not time to declare now.+++[+++_torn._]
came in another manner;--the 19th day, my master came alluring me,
and crying with tears running from a broken cistern.
On the 23rd day, he sent me to one, to whom he had spoken to confer with me,
with whom I was most part of that day; and my master did tell him,
that if he could not draw me from my delusions and errors,
that he would have me before the Chamberlain of London,
and there my indentures should be burnt or torn; and I,
for the scandal cast upon him under my hand, to be sent to the House of Correction,
and to lose the freedom of the city of London.--Lose my name and credit!--poor, empty,
base, beggarly things, which are not worth my thought:
if it were to lose ten thousand freedoms, I would lose them willingly upon this account;
and for witnessing the Truth--welcome House of Correction,
or any other punishment!--and for Christ--farewell name, credit and reputation!

He +++[+++his master]
has drawn up a charge of five particulars against me:--

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
_1st._--That I had slanderously accused him by word of mouth, +++[+++_as stated above._]

[.numbered]
_2nd._--That I frequented a meeting in Moorfields,
where there is none but two women that are preachers.

[.numbered]
_3rd._--That I will not join with him in family duties, namely,
sometimes twice a day prayer; and every Lord`'s day two prayers, a chapter or a Psalm,
and commonly one sung; and the like singing and prayer at night.

[.numbered]
_4th._--That when customers come for goods, my not speaking to them,
as to tell them of what they ask me, or bidding them welcome, etc.,
I have driven away his customers.

[.numbered]
_5th._--Being asked by him whether I would refer the
controversy to be ended by the ministers of God,
I told him that I would; but I thought I could not find any of them in +++[+++London,
_perhaps,--part torn._]
These are the five things, which he, poor soul, thinks to affright me with.

====

The last first-day, Isabel^
footnote:[Isabel Buttery, doubtless.]--who has been a long season with us,
I know not whether she is known to you,
but she is well known to James Nayler and Gervase Benson and other
Friends who were lately in London,--was moved to go to Westminster,
to some to whom her heart was drawn forth; intending to make no stay, if the Lord would,
but to come to our meeting at Simon Dring`'s house in Watling-street.^
footnote:[Gilbert Latey states,
that Simon Dring was one of those who first offered up their houses "`to have meetings
therein for the service of the Lord`" and that he "`then lived in Watling-street;
but some time after, he removed into Moorfields,
where he continued to have a meeting in his house.`"]
But as she came back by Paul`'s, the Mayor caused the marshal so called,
to bring her before him; and her spirit was carried out valiantly:
they went together into the vestry, there she--as we were informed--was +++[+++_word not clear_]
in discourse with him, the Aldermen and Recorder so called.
So they sent her to the House of Correction called Bridewell,
and another maid that went with her, which was Robert Dring`'s maid of Moorfields.
I went to see them, with more of our Friends, the last night;
but there was no admittance,
their Pharisaical spirit would not permit such things on their Sabbath day.
They were committed for letting people have their books,
which our Friends have been moved to publish.
Isabel bid me inform our Friends, that there are some books to be sent down: [.book-title]#The Way to the Kingdom,# with an addition to it, is come forth.
Send by the next post where they shall be sent to, and by whom and to whom.

Now, dear friend, I have in as brief a way as I could,
informed you and the rest of my friends,
as our dear friends Frances Howgill and John Camm;
desiring that +++_______+++ your petitions may be spread before the Lord,
that we might be kept faithful to the end; for +++[+++such, there is (?)]
laid up a crown of life.
Salute us to all our dear brethren: farewell, the eternal God of power +++[+++preserve you (?)]

[.salutation]
Dear Friend,

I have long professed to serve and worship the true God,
and as I thought--above many sects--attained to a high pitch in religion; but now, alas!
I find my work will not abide the fire.
My notions were swelling vanities without power or life: what it was to love enemies,
to bless them that curse, to render good for evil, to use the world as using it not,
to lay down life for the brethren, I never understood; what purity and perfection meant,
I never tasted: all my religion was but the hearing of the ear,
the believing and talking of a God and Christ in heaven or a place at a distance,
I knew not where.
Oh! how gracious was the Lord to me in carrying me to Judge Fell`'s,
to see the wonders of His power and wisdom,--a family walking in the fear of the Lord,
conversing daily with Him, crucified to the world, and living only to God.
I was so confounded, all my knowledge and wisdom became folly; my mouth was stopped,
my conscience convinced, and the secrets of my heart were made manifest,
and that Lord was discovered to be near, whom I ignorantly worshipped.

I could have talked of Christ in the saints the hope of glory, but it was a riddle to me.
And truly, dear friend, I must tell you I have now lost all my religion,
and am in such distress I have no hope nor foundation left.
My justification and assurance have forsaken me,
and I am even like a poor shattered vessel, tossed to and fro, without a pilot or rudder;
as blind, dead, and helpless, as you can imagine.
I never felt corruption so strong, and temptation so prevailing, as now; I have a proud,
hard, flinty heart, that cannot be sensible of my misery.
When I deeply consider how much precious time I have wasted,
and how unprofitably I have lived, my spirit feels a sudden fear;
but then I am still flying to my old refuge, and there my thoughts are diverted.
What it means to wait upon God, I cannot apprehend; and the confusions in my own spirit,
together with the continual temptations from without, are so great,
I cannot understand or perceive the small still voice of the Lord.

What you told me of George Fox, I found true:
when you see him or James Nayler,--they both know my condition better than myself,--move
them--if neither of them be drawn this way,--to help me with their counsel by letter;
they are full of pity and compassion; and though I was their enemy, they are my friends:
and so is Francis Howgill,
from whom I received a letter full of tenderness and wholesome advice.
Oh! how welcome would the faces of any of them be to me;
truly I think I could scorn the world, to have fellowship with them.
But I find my heart is full of deceit,
and I exceedingly fear to be beguiled,--as I have
been,--and to be seduced into a form without power,
into a profession before I possess the Truth; which will multiply my misery,
and deprive me both of God and the world.

Dear friend,
there is a carrier comes from Kendal within a mile of my house every fortnight,
and he shall call at Peter Huggins`' to bring any letter that shall be there left for me;
it will much refresh me to receive any lines from you;--but be faithful.
You may perceive, by my Ashdod language,
what countryman I am--even of the low world that lives in darkness.
I am afraid lest the orders we made at Appleby,^
footnote:[Perhaps, as Magistrates.]
cause some to suffer, who speak from the mouth of the Lord;
I heartily wish they were suppressed or recalled.
I have seen at Judge Fell`'s, and have been informed from that precious soul his consort,
in some measure what those things mean,
which before I counted the overflowings of giddy brains.
Dear heart, pity and pray for me;
and let all obligations of former friendship be discharged
in well wishes to the soul of the old family friend,
that he may partake with them of your heavenly possessions.

[.salutation]
Most Dearly Beloved,

The last night but one, I came to my dwelling at +++[+++_name not clear._]
I left Francis Howgill and Edward Burrough, John Camm and Richard Hubberthorne in London,
the second-day of last week.
At London, we found very many who have a true principle of honesty in them;
but they are for the most part so high flown in wisdom and notions,
that it is hard to reach them: nothing can enter till their wisdom be confounded;
and if they be judged, then presently they rage, and their wrath is stirred up,
and so the simplicity is trampled upon.
Much wisdom is to be used among them, until the truth be clearly understood;
and then to speak to that in their consciences, to the raising up of the witness,
to let them see themselves; and then to pass judgment upon them,
and so to keep them under from disputing and questioning.
This we found the most profitable ministry; and few words must be used:
for they have held the Truth in notions; and all cry out, "`What do these men say,
more than others have said?`"
but to bring them to silence confounds their wisdom.

Oh! that none might come to London, but those who are raised up into the life of Truth,
who dwell in the living power of God, whose words may have authority:
for there are so many mighty in wisdom to oppose and gainsay,
that weak ones will allow the Truth to be trampled on;
and there are so many rude savage apprentices and young people and Ranters,
that nothing but the power of the Lord can chain them.
Dear heart, let none go to London,
but in the clear and pure movings of the Spirit of Life;
that the blessing may rest upon them.
And great is the harvest like to be in that city; hundreds are convinced,
and thousands wait to see the issue, who have persuasions that it is the Truth.
Very many societies we have visited, and are now able to stand:
many honest hearts are among the Waiters,
and some that are joined to the Ranters are a decent people.^
footnote:[In a letter from Edward Burrough to Margaret Fell,
(date of 1654) he thus writes:--
{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`We
were at a meeting of the people called Waiters +++[+++in London]
where Richard Hubberthorne spoke about half an hour in much power and wisdom.--Francis
Howgill was moved to go to an assembly of people called Seekers;
and they were, as all in this generation practices,
jangling and contending about the meaning of the Scriptures;
and he stood silent among them a little,
and then spoke of the word of the Lord in power with boldness, an hour or more,
and confounded their wisdom, and crushed their meaning of the Scripture: he said,
there were some pretty good people among them.`"--([.book-title]#William Caton`'s MSS.
Collection.#)]
The living power of God was made manifest to the confounding of all,
and we were carried above ourselves, to the astonishment both of ourselves and others:
we were made to speak tremblingly among them in dread and much fear.

When I can hear where you are, I must come to you.
Dear heart, pray for me and all with me, that we may be kept in the fear of the Lord,
to the praise of his great name.
The bearer hastens me, and I can now write no more,
only my wife`'s and family`'s love to all Friends.

namely, Francis Howgill and Edward Burrough,
who were the first that declared Truth publicly there;
whom He made instruments in his hands for the gathering of many, who,
like good old Simeon, were waiting for the consolation of Israel.`"
The letter is very descriptive of the state of things among professors at this period;

labourers in the gospel of Christ in this great city,

[.salutation]
Dear Sister,

Great is our care and charge which is committed unto us;
pray that we may be kept in faithfulness and boldness
in the work of the Lord committed to us,
and that wisdom may guide us to handle the sword;
that we may clearly discern what to spare and what to destroy.
Great is our travail, till Christ be brought forth in this people;
and our suffering is even with and for the pure seed, which lies in bondage in this city.
We two are constrained to stay in this city; but we are not alone,
for the power of our Father is with us, and it is daily made manifest through weakness,
even to the stopping of the mouths of lions,
and to the confounding of the serpent`'s wisdom;--eternal praises to Him forevermore!

In this city iniquity is grown to the height,--the serpent`'s wisdom is grown
fully ripe;--here are the subtlest serpents to grapple with and war with:
but in the eternal light--which is our shield and buckler,--are they comprehended,
and their deceits made manifest to us, and by the light are they judged and condemned.
We have three meetings or more every week, very large, more than any place will contain,
and which we can conveniently meet in.
Many of all sorts come to us, and many of all sects are convinced,--yes,
hundreds do believe;
and by the power of the gospel declared among them is the witness of God raised,
which shall never die.
There are some brought under the power exceedingly,
which strikes terror into the hearts of many; and many lie under true judgment,
and a true love is raised up in many, and the time of redemption to many is drawing near.
As yet we know little of our departing from here:
to all do we and shall we clear our consciences, and be free from the blood of all men,
and finish our testimony.

Many begin to consider of us, and think there is something more in it than a bare notion;
at the first, they looked upon it to be no more: but it sinks deep inward in many;
for to that we speak, which brings us in remembrance when they see us not.^
footnote:[Gough, in his [.book-title]#History,#
after alluding to the visit of Edward Burrough and
Francis Howgill to London at this time,
remarks:--"`Their ministerial labours were blessed with signal success;
being attended with a convincing power, impressing awful considerations,
and awakening the consciences of the audience to a sense
of their conditions and earnest desires after salvation.`"
It should be borne in mind at the same time,
that this was a period remarkable for the zealous maintenance
of religious _profession_ in the community generally;
and probably the language of Scripture was pretty familiar to professors at large.
Gough continues,--(after stating that Edward Burrough and Francis Howgill
proceeded to Bristol,)--"`Their preaching was like that of the apostles,
in the demonstration of the Spirit and with power: multitudes flocked to hear them,
and many embraced their doctrines.`"--[.book-title]#Gough`'s History,# vol. i. p.143]
The last first-day but one, I was at a steeple-house in the forenoon,
and had liberty to speak what I was free,
and passed away to the meeting in the afternoon.
Last first-day,
Richard Hubberthorne and I went twelve miles out of the city to a great meeting of Separatists,
to a place called Theobald`'s,^
footnote:[George Fox speaks of this place not far from Waltham Abbey,
"`near which Colonel Packer lived.
He set up a great meeting of the Baptists at Theobald`'s Park;
for he and some other officers had purchased it.
They were exceedingly high and railed against Friends
and Truth,`" etc.--See the [.book-title]#Journal# under 1654.]
where many great men were, and officers in the army, and such like;
and we had pretty good liberty to let forth ourselves;
but at the end the heads of them put us violently forth,
which many simple minds owned not in them.
The fourth-day of last week, we had a meeting in Southwark, in a large room,
where some Anabaptists meet on the first-days; several of them were there,
and many hundred people.

Our dear brethren, John Audland and John Camm,
went from us the last sixth-day out of this city towards Oxford,
to be there the last first-day; our hearts were broken in separating one from another,
for our lives are bound up in one, and we partake of one another`'s sufferings,
and of one another`'s joy.
We receive letters every week from the prisoners at Chester:
the work of the Lord goes on gloriously in that county, there is precious seed;
and Anthony Pearson writes to us of the like in the county of Bishopric, +++[+++Durham;]
it is even our reward to hear that the Lord is raising that up in power,
which was sown in weakness: to the Lord of glory, be glory forevermore!

Remember us dearly to all Friends, for we are refreshed in the remembrance of you.
Our chiefest care is, that we may be preserved in obedience, in power, and in wisdom;
that the Lord may be glorified by us.
We rest from writing, but continue to be your dearly beloved brethren in the Lord.

Dear Brother,

Edward Burrough and I stay still in this city:--large is the love of God to us,
and the work of the Lord prospers in our hands;--eternal living praises to Him forevermore.
We are here among this great people in much weakness; and when we see such multitudes,
we are often put to a stand where one might get bread to satisfy so many.
But the wisdom and power of God has been with us, and there are hundreds convinced;
but not many great or noble do receive our testimony:
yet there are many put to a stand and brought into silence,
and many are under deep judgment and a true power.
We have had many great giants to encounter with;
but by the power of the Lord the mouths of lions have been stopped,
and our adversaries have been put to flight.

We have been in great service continually, since we came into this filthy place:
here is the trimmed harlot, the mystery of witchcraft: and the devil rules,
and is head in all sorts.
We have been at the most eminent societies in the city,
and we have had strong fightings with them over and over, and at some steeple-houses;
and but that they have our persons in contempt,
they say none speak like us:--but the devil cannot stoop so low.
We have two or three meetings in the week, but no place large enough;
so that we are much put to it.
And we have been guided in much wisdom,
so that all them that hate us have nothing to accuse us of,
as of tumults or disorder in the least: some wait to entrap us,
but in wisdom we are guided; praised be the Lord!

Miles Halhead and James Lancaster were here, and came to visit us;
they stayed one first-day, and so were moved towards Cambridge.
We are much refreshed;
we receive letters from all quarters;--the work goes on
fast everywhere;--eternal living praises to Him forever!

and are in joy and peace in the Lord: to Him be praise eternal forevermore.`"]
Our dear brethren, John Audland and John Camm, we hear from,

[.salutation]
Dear Sister,

Upon the 4th day of the 12th month, George Fox was at a meeting at Swannington;
and there came several soldiers from Leicester, but they were very civil and moderate,
and heard with patience the word of the Lord, and went peaceably away.
The same day Thomas Taylor and I were at Litchfield, and had a meeting there;
when many people of all sorts came to the meeting.
On the fourth-day of the week we came to George at Swannington;
and he was moved to appoint a meeting at Whetstone,
and none being there to pass along with him, I went with him.

On the first-day, many Friends were come together from several parts,
and were waiting upon the Lord,
when there came the marshal and about eight soldiers into the meeting;
and many of them sat down, and were very civil.
And after a certain while, the marshal spoke, and showed an order from Colonel Hacker,
that everyone should go to their outward habitations,
otherwise to pass along with him to the Colonel.
And so he began and examined Friends where their outward abode was;
and some he asked when they would return back.
As for George his countryman,--let any two go along with him,
and satisfy the Colonel for the rest.
Then the marshal did entreat George to take his horse
and go along with them Then said George,
"`if you do command me to go, I shall not resist:`" So they went,
and I had not freedom to leave George.
They were then introduced to Colonel Hacker--and the colonel spoke to him of many things.
He was then searched, and finally was informed, he must go to London.
One captain Drury, one of the Protector`'s life-guards passed up,
and we went along with him.

+++[+++After stating that they lodged at the Mermaid Inn, Charing Cross, the letter proceeds.]
Then the Captain went to the Protector, and acquainted him of their arrival;
so the Protector said, he should see him,--and would speak with George; but when,
he could not tell.
The captain is very loving, and would not hinder George of any freedom; only desired,
that one of us would stay at the inn.
On the fourth-day, George went up into the city with some of our Friends.
On first-day afternoon, William Caton and I were at a meeting in Moorfields,
where many Friends were: a mighty power there is among them,
and many tender hearts there are among them.
On the fourth-day in the evening,
there was a meeting appointed at Gerard Roberts`'
where there was a very large meeting of Friends;
George was present among them: the powerful presence of the Lord was with us,
and the tender plants were refreshed, and some were made to witness to the Truth.

+++[+++The next letter follows up the narrative of George Fox`'s being taken before the Protector.
In his [.book-title]#Journal,#
George Fox gives a full and interesting account of
this interview with Oliver Cromwell at Whitehall:
it was on this occasion that a paper was addressed by George Fox to the Protector,
in which he denied "`the taking up a carnal weapon against him or any man,`" etc.
After this interview the Protector declared "`he was at liberty,
and might go where he would.`"^
footnote:[This circumstance respecting George Fox being brought up before the Protector,
is spoken of in these terms in the News-books of the day:
{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`We have information of several Quakers,
who have of late been roving about the country in Leicestershire,
and have had many meeting there, but were dispersed by some of our horse,
and some of them taken into custody; among the rest, one Fox, a chief Quaker,
who was this day brought to Whitehall, and had many followers.`"
--([.book-title]#The Perfect Diurnal,# Feb. 19th, 1655.)
{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`Monday, 26th February, 1655.
This afternoon Fox the great Quaker, who is said to be one of the chief among them,
was at Whitehall: he came out of Leicestershire: some say he was sent up from there;
many Quakers were at Whitehall following him.`"
It appears from this account that the Friends "`stayed
some hours at Whitehall`" on this occasion.--([.book-title]#Tracts, King`'s Library, British Museum.#)
{footnote-paragraph-split}
On glancing over the reports of the
transactions of Cromwell`'s Council about the beginning of this year,
when George Fox was arrested by Colonel Hacker,
it appears that many persons of various stations in life,
were reported to the Council as either suspicious,
or as directly implicated in plots for bringing in
"`Charles Stuart`" and subverting Cromwell`'s government:
many of these persons were brought up and examined
before the Protector and his Council at Whitehall,
during the first two or three months of this year;
and several were convicted and punished.
These circumstances, doubtless, tended to spread suspicions far and wide;
and probably afforded employment for the officious partizan
to show his zeal in the discovery of suspected persons,
of whatever character and station they might be.]]

[.salutation]
Most Dearly Beloved,

Our dearly beloved one George Fox is set free by Oliver Cromwell to go where he pleases:
he was never under any restraint, but had liberty to pass among Friends.
On the 6th day of this month, he was brought before the Protector,
and was with him a pretty good while in his chamber at Westminster:
he was very loving to him, and wished him to come again to him;
and afterwards set him free to go where he pleased.

So we are yet in this city, and for a while continue in it:
there are many Friends come up, as Francis Howgill and Edward Burrough, Thomas Salthouse,
Miles Halhead, William Caton, John Stubbs, and several others;
but I believe we shall disperse abroad after tomorrow.
We do not lack anything; here are many precious Friends in the city,
who would do anything for us, or let us have anything; but George is not very free,
but rather keeps clear.
Our horses are at the inn where we lay; but so many coming to see George,
they +++[+++the people of the inn]
grow weary and wish us to take another place; only the horses might be free left.
So at present I cease; with my tender love unto you and your family.

Dear Sister,

Who are a fruitful branch in the living vine, and a pleasant plant in the garden of God.^
footnote:[It is remarkable with what high esteem and christian love,
Margaret Fell appears to have been regarded by our early and most eminent Friends;
she seems to have been generally acknowledged as
the faithful nursing-mother of the flock;
and she often addressed them when in bonds or otherwise,
with letters of consolation and encouragement:
it is also probable she contributed largely to the relief of their outward necessities.]
We have been in this city near three weeks in great labour and service.
George Fox, with many more of our brethren, was here when we came.
We all stayed over one first-day, after we two came into the city,
George was that day in private with Friends;
and we two were in the general meeting place among the rude world,
threshing and ploughing:--and the rest of our brethren were that day at several meetings,
some at one and some at another, and some among the Baptists and gathered people;
and great service there was that day.

Then shortly after that first-day, the brethren separated into the fields +++[+++the country,]
to reap and to gather in.
Richard Cleaton and Thomas Bond went towards Norwich and into Suffolk and that way,
and are in great service there.
John Stubbs and William Caton went towards Dover.
We have received one letter from them since they went into Dover:
the mayor and the officers strictly examined and charged them to keep the peace:
they were with some gathered people, and at some steeple-houses,
and had little persecution.
Miles Halhead and Thomas Salthouse went towards Plymouth:
they had a great meeting one first-day in Reading; and many, they wrote, were convinced.
George Fox is at present in Bedfordshire; Alexander Parker is with him:
there is a people that way.

John Audland was here with us, but goes towards Bristol shortly, for all we know.
James Lancaster was with us in this city, but is gone to George.
Richard Hubberthorne is yet in prison.
John Camm is at or near Bristol.
We believe that George will return to this city again,--we
two are too few in this city for this service,
for truly it is very great;
at present many come in daily to the acknowledgment of the Truth.
Friends are so many, that not one place can hold them on the first-days,
where we can peaceably meet for the rude people; for since we came,
they have been very rude,--very often to pull us down when we have been speaking.

George was at the great meeting place two first-days before we came;
and his voice and outward man was almost spent among them.
We have thus ordered it since we came,--we get Friends on the first-days
to meet together in several places out of the rude multitude,
etc.; and we two go to the great meeting place which we have,
which will hold a thousand people, which is always nearly filled,
there to thresh among the world; and we stay till twelve or one o`'clock,
and then pass away, the one to one place and the other to another place,
where Friends are met in private; and stay till four or five o`'clock.^
footnote:[It seems they had so much work with the multitude,
that they could with difficulty get together with their own body:
one letter from Francis Howgill, dated London, 2nd of 8th month, 1654, states,
"`our burden is great, we cannot get any separation for the multitude,
and so Friends do not much know one another:
and we cannot conveniently get any place to meet in, that Friends may sit down.`"]

Truly, dear heart, our care is for the whole body,
that all things may be ordered in the wisdom of God,
to the confounding of all our adversaries, who seek for our halting.

We rest in the bosom of love with you, and are your dear brothers,

Dear Sister,

My tender and dear love in the Lord Jesus Christ,
salutes you and other my dear and precious friends in your family.
Grace, mercy, and peace, be multiplied among you,
from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.

Upon the 16th day of the first month, George and I, and some other city Friends,
passed out of this city to Justice Crook`'s house in Bedfordshire: he is an _honest_ man,
and there will be a precious family; his wife is brought very low,
and is of a very tender heart,--and others in his family.
Upon the 18th day, being first-day, there was a meeting at the justice`'s house,
where there were many people, and all sober and quiet.^
footnote:[George Fox, speaking of this meeting at John Crook`'s,
says--"`It was a great meeting, and people were generally convinced of the Lord`'s truth.
When I was come there, John Crook told me,
that the next day several of those that were called gentlemen of the county,
would come to dine with him, and to discourse with me.
They came, and I declared to them God`'s eternal truth.
John Crook was kept by the power of the Lord;
yet he was turned out from being a justice.`"--[.book-title]#Journal,#
1654-5.
{footnote-paragraph-split}
John Crook lived to an advanced age;
our Hertfordshire Register records his decease as
follows:--
{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`John Crook,
an ancient and honourable Friend and elder,
a minister of the Gospel about forty-four years,
died at Hertford the 26th of the 2nd month,
1699 and was buried at Sewel the 30th of the same, aged near 82 years.`"]
George stayed at Justice Crook`'s house, and we were there about fifteen days;
I and others had many meetings in the country thereabouts: John Audland was there,
and James Lancaster, and Gervase Benson, Thomas Story, Thomas Stubbs, and some others:
we were in great service while we stayed there.
A great ferment +++[+++_word indistinct (?)_]
is in that country and other places thereabouts.

Upon the last day of the first month, George and Gervase Benson and I came to this city:
we had five meetings, three of Friends that met in silence,
and George was at one of them, where many of the world came in, but were sober.
Francis Howgill and Edward Burrough were at the great meeting place,
where many came to hear.
Gervase Benson and I were at a meeting beyond Westminster,
where there are many convinced: in the forenoon having such short notice,
there were not many; but in the afternoon there came very many,
and they were sober quiet people.
George Whitehead is again imprisoned, for coming to the grate to visit Friends.
John Stubbs and William Caton, have been three times carried before the mayor at Dover,
but are yet at liberty as far as I know.

Dear Sister,

Our dearly beloved George Fox is yet in this city,
and I know little at present of his removing.
The work is great, and many are daily convinced:
we have seven or eight meetings every first-day, and all are pretty quiet.
Francis and Edward had a great dispute with the chief
of the Baptists on the third-day of this week;
and on fourth-day another with two of the chief of the Water Baptists;
many of their hearers--who are not satisfied--came, and some of our Friends;
and the power of the Lord was over them:
though they are a very wise and subtle generation,
yet the Lord by his wisdom in weak ones confounds and overturns them.
A great shatter is among all the forms and gathered churches--as
they are called;--and many are inquiring after the Truth.^
footnote:[[.book-title]#George Fox`'s Journal,# 1654.--"`The Presbyterians, Independents,
and Baptists were greatly disturbed;
for many of their people turned to the Lord Jesus Christ,
and sat down under his teaching: they received his power and felt it in their hearts;
and then they were moved of the Lord to declare against the rest of them.`"]

Concerning our Friends in Northampton,^
footnote:[Among whom were William Dewsbury and John Whitehead: See [.book-title]#Life of Dewsbury,# Chap.
7 and 8.]
they all continue in prison; as far as I know,
Yorkshire Friends have been lately with them, and have supplied their necessities:
those in Bedford likewise continue +++[+++in prison?]
And for Friends at Norwich they are all released but Christopher Atkinson,
John Stubbs and William Caton were with us the last week;
they are sweetly carried on in the work of the Lord, and are much strengthened;
they went back again towards Dover.
John Slee and Thomas Lawson went into Sussex:
John Wilkinson and John Story are going westward.
Thomas Salthouse and Miles Halhead are about Bristol, and lack nothing;
nor any Friends,--for as they come up here, if any are in need,
our friends Frances and Edward supply them: the charge truly is great,
but our desire is to make it as easy as possibly we can.

Here are in this city many precious Friends, and they begin to know George,
though at the first he was strange to them; and one thing they all take notice of,
that if George be in the company, all the rest are for the most part silent,
which they did much wonder at.^
footnote:[This appears to have been George Fox`'s first
visit to London since the settlement of the Society.]
Our brethren Thomas Aldam and Anthony Pearson came into the city last night,
they are now with George: Francis and Edward and Gervase Benson are all here;
who would have their dear love remembered to you and all our Friends in your family.
Dearly salute me to my dear sisters your children,
and to the rest of the precious Friends who are faithful to the Lord with you.
The eternal God of peace and love keep you all, and establish you in his love.
Let your prayers be for me, that I may go on in the power of our God,
and be preserved above all temptation, to his glory!

My Dearly Beloved Sister,

I know that it is your joy to learn the prosperity of the work of the Lord,
that he may be exalted, who has covered us,
and has chosen us to bear witness unto his glorious name,
and to publish his everlasting love abroad;
that all may come to know the way to eternal life.
Truly the arm of the Lord is with us in wisdom, in strength, in power, in utterance,
in boldness; so that I cannot but say, O! the infinite riches of his love and mercy,
which are inexpressible.

Dear heart, praise the Lord on our behalf; and let all that know him rejoice with us.
In his love and power I will glory; but of myself I will not.
Pray for us, for our work is doubled,--our care is doubled;
but our strength is also renewed.
The work is great in this city, but even few are fitted for it.
The last first-day there were ten meetings in the city,
and the work lies upon George Fox and us two, +++[+++Francis Howgill and Edward Burrough;]
here are a precious people, they grow up in wisdom and life, and many are added.
All the priests and all the gathered congregations in the city preach against us,
and are bent in great rage, and print lies, and incense people much.
Edward Burrough and I have ordinarily two public disputes with the heads of them;
and they lose their members so fast, they know not what to do:
yet the city is pretty calm and quiet; and wisdom begins to grow among Friends,
and several are moved to go forth in the ministry.

Two young men and two young women are moved to go to Barbados, out of the city;
and another young man, a Scotchman, is moved to go for Scotland;
and other two women are gone to Wales, and other two to Oxford,--all these are citizens.
And many are moved to go to their churches, which they were of, and declare against them;
and some to the steeple-houses, and yet are preserved at liberty.
Here are many Friends come up about tithes; there are near thirty in the city,
and much care lies upon us to order them,
and for the brethren abroad that are in the work of the Lord, or in bonds.

Anthony Pearson, Gervase Benson, and Thomas Aldam are here;
their service is now much about Friends appearing at courts this term about tithes.
Alexander Parker is gone into Bedfordshire.
John Stubbs has some movings for Holland with William Caton,
and he is in Kent with Thomas Robertson and Ambrose Rigge.
John Slee, and Thomas Lawson are gone into Sussex; Miles Halhead,
and Thomas Salthouse are gone towards Plymouth.
Our liberty here is of much advantage to all the churches of Christ
everywhere,--glory be to Him that preserves us in his bosom,

Yesterday I came from Justice Crook`'s to this city: Friends are well here,
and the Truth flourishes,--glory to our God forever!

Our dear brethren Francis Howgill and Edward Burrough,
went this day out of the city towards Norwich, Norfolk and Suffolk:
their love is dearly remembered to you and your family.
Gervase Benson and Anthony Pearson and Thomas Aldam are yet in town,
but intend shortly to return towards the north: they were yesterday with the Protector,
and delivered some papers to him concerning our Friends`' imprisonment;
and they spoke to him of many things:
he was very moderate and promised to read the papers.
Miles Halhead and Thomas Salthouse are in prison at Plymouth upon the oath of abjuration,

Jane Waugh is set free at Banbury:
Elizabeth Fletcher and Elizabeth Holmes are set free at Dublin,

Your letters I have received:--those to Oliver Cromwell are both delivered into his hand;
but he is full of subtlety and deceit, will speak fair, but he hardens his heart,
and acts secretly underneath.
Our army is most scattered and broken, and cast into prison;
I know none almost at liberty but George and Alexander Parker, Edward Burrough,
and I and Gervase Benson; and except John Stubbs and William Caton,
John Wilkinson and John Story, and it is like they cannot be long out:
yet truly the power of the Lord is over all.
The work of the Lord is great, and goes on fast,
notwithstanding all the rage of the heathen.

George Fox is here.
We have five or six meetings every first-day of Friends,
besides two great places for a threshing floor;
and we have set up a meeting a little beyond Whitehall near Westminster:
many are coming in, and many inquiring,
and many are convinced daily:--glory and honour forever to the
Lord!Richard Cleaton and Richard Hubberthorne remain in bonds;
but George Whitehead and Dorothy Waugh are at liberty +++[+++_from Norwich jail

James Lancaster and Thomas Stubbs, and another Friend are imprisoned at Bedford.
Edward Burrough is gone to Edmondsbury.
I shall take care for the supply of Friends in these parts, while I am here;
and truly I fear lest the burden should be heavy upon the North, for the charge is great,

Dearly Beloved Sister,--dearly do I salute you.

Our life is one, our joy one, our suffering one,
our food and raiment one,--eating both of one bread,
and drinking both of one cup in the Father`'s house; where there is bread enough,
and wells of living water to refresh the tender plants;
where the babes are nourished and fed with the milk,
and receive their food in due season;
where there is joy and rejoicing in the presence of the Lord, and pleasures forevermore;
which only those do enjoy who have followed the Lamb
through many tribulations and fiery trials and temptations,
and have overcome by the blood of the Lamb, and their garments washed white and clean.

Hallelujah! praises to His glorious name forever, who has called and chosen us,
and made us partakers of the divine nature;
and has redeemed us from the world and the pollutions of it,
to be witnesses of His powerful name:
and in his power and free love has He sent us abroad into the world,
to turn others from darkness and their vain conduct;
that they may have union with us in the light of his Son,
and praise and glorify his eternal majesty forever and forevermore!

The Truth in this city spreads and flourishes; many large meetings we have,
and great ones of the world come to them, and are much tendered.
James Nayler is fitted for this great place,
and a great love is begotten in many towards him.^
footnote:[In a letter dated 28th of 5th month +++[+++7th month+++]+++
of this year, Alexander Parker writes thus respecting James Nayler:
"`James Nayler on fourth-day had a great dispute
with some of the chief of the separated congregations;
and it being public, a great meeting there was;
(it was in one of their own meetinghouses;) and
truly it was much for the advancement of Truth;
for though they were--(_word not intelligible_) yet they were much confounded.
James is very serviceable here, and his fame begins to spread in the city,
seeing that he has had public disputes with many.`"
{footnote-paragraph-split}
This was rather more than a year before James Nayler`'s fall;
and it appears from [.book-title]#George Fox`'s Journal,#
that it was towards the close of this year that George Fox had a fear respecting him.
The reader will probably observe, in the above extract,
matter for reflection in regard to James Nayler`'s subsequent career.]
Our dear one, George Fox, does purpose this week to pass into the country northward,
but how far north I cannot yet tell.
On next fifth-day but one, a meeting is appointed in Lincolnshire,
where George does purpose to be;
at present I know nothing but that I shall pass with him; if otherwise it be ordered,

We received a letter from Francis and Edward out of Ireland; they have had many meetings,

My Sister Dearly Loved in the Lord,

Yesterday I had a meeting at a house called Lady Darcy`'s;^
footnote:[George Fox, in his journal, speaks of a female of the name of "`Abigail Darcy,
who was called a lady;--she was convinced of the truth.`"]
many were there from the Court, some called lords--as it is said,--several ladies,
several officers of the army, some of the +++[+++chief?
_word not clear_]
priests in the city, how many I know not; for they got behind a ceiling,
and came not out till I was gone.
Though there were some Baptists asked a question or two after I
had done,--tending to plead for sin,--and were silenced;
yet not one priest would speak a word, nor stand up for their kingdom.
I was moved to call to any that had anything to oppose, to speak to the face;
but none would answer.

Two or three of Henry Vane`'s brethren were there all the while,
and he himself kept behind, but came after all was ended: he is very loving to Friends,
but drunk with imaginations:^
footnote:[Vane was a conspicuous character at this period and subsequently:--he
was strongly attached to a republican government,
and opposed Cromwell in this progress towards assuming the reins of government as Protector.
He was said to be one of the leaders of the Independents.
Burnet the historian says of him:--"`Though he set
up a form of religion in a way of his own,
yet it consisted rather in a withdrawing from all other forms,
than in any new or particular forms and opinions;
from which he and his party were called Seekers,
and seemed to wait for some new and clearer manifestations.`"
He was one of the Committee of Public Safety in Richard Cromwell`'s time:
after the restoration of King Charles, he was sacrificed on the scaffold in 1662.]
there is a band of them sunk therein, and do harm to some among them,
who else would be very tender; many are brought to tears when they hear the Truth.

Dear Brother,

In the love of our God we salute you and all Friends in the Truth.
Blessed be the Lord God of power and glory, who has called us to so high a calling,
as to bear witness to his name, and to publish the everlasting Gospel;
praises eternal be to our God forever!

Dear brethren, we are with you in your bonds, in your reproaches and imprisonments,
and in your rejoicings; your joy is ours,
for we eat with you and drink with you at our Father`'s table,
where there is plenteous nourishment for all those who wait in his counsel,
and are obedient to his commands.
Dear brethren, our care is great;--the harvest is great;
who are sufficient for these things?
Here are fields white unto harvest; and much of the power of God has been with us.

Great has been our burden and our work since we came here, and our reward is great.
Much have we been drawn out to administer in power and wisdom.
We have exceedingly great meetings of all sorts,
and we labour and travail until Christ be formed in them.
Pray for us, that we may be kept in His power,
which reigns over all:--by the power of the Lord the mouths of lions are stopped,
kings are bound in chains:--eternal living praises forevermore to Him, who rides on,
conquering in power and great glory! many are brought
under great judgment and true power,
and many have learned their own condemnation.

The last first-day,
my dear yokefellow and I went in the forenoon to two of the highest
notionists and the greatest deceivers in the city,
at two steeple-houses, where the wise of the city come; and I had great liberty,
and spoke towards an hour; all were silent,
and some confessed they never heard so much truth in power delivered.
Many would have had me to their houses; but we lay hands on none hastily.
James Lancaster and Miles Halhead are come here,
but I believe they will not stay long here,
Richard Hubberthorne is in prison at Cambridge,
Thomas Holmes is also in prison at Chester, with seven or eight besides.

We have received letters from Kendal,
there are nine or ten in prison there and at Appleby.
From Bristol we have received letters from our dear brethren John Audland and John Camm;
the mighty power of the Lord is that way: that is a precious city, and a gallant people:
their net is like to break with fishes,
they have caught so much there and all the coast thereabout:
mighty is His work and power in this His day!
Shout for joy all you holy ones! for the Lord rides on in power to get himself a name;
and let all that know the Lord praise him, for his mercy endures forever!

Captain Stoddart +++[+++Amos S.]
has wrote to you and Samuel Watson; your letters he has received,
but how they can be delivered I know not.^
footnote:[Perhaps some addresses to Cromwell or others in power are here meant.]
We have three or four more, but we find no moving to deliver them:
here is such stirring about his power +++[+++Cromwell`'s:]
he carries all with a high hand; 200 of the parliament are gone home.^
footnote:[This appears to be a period in Cromwell`'s Protectorate when
the republican characters of the day were found too stiff for him.
Among the leaders of this party were two persons, who are named in these letters,
Vane and Rich.
These men Cromwell committed to prison, for not submitting, as he thought,
to his authority.
From Mackintosh`'s [.book-title]#History of England,# vol.
vi. p. 217, we learn,
that "`the meeting of Parliament stood for the 17th of September`"
+++[+++two days before the date of this letter:]
Cromwell on this occasion "`resorted to an exercise of power so arbitrary and sweeping,
as to render the summoning of Parliament a mockery.`"
The members after hearing the Protector`'s speech "`in the Painted Chamber,
proceeded to their house.
They found the door guarded by soldiers,
who admitted none but those provided with a certificate
of the approbation of Cromwell`'s council,
signed by the clerk of the commonwealth.
This ticket had been withheld from about 100 members, and they were excluded.`"
This was the Parliament that sat on James Nayler`'s case.]
But as for those things, they are nothing to us, we are redeemed from them;
praises to the Lord forevermore, who has made us to reign above the world,
and to trample upon it!

Dear brother, farewell! salute us to all that are faithful in their measure received.
Our dear love to you and John Kilham, and all the rest of the Lord`'s faithful witnesses;

+++[+++We are now arrived at the period of James Nayler`'s fall,

the reader must be referred to [.book-title]#Sewel`'s History# under this date,
the account of which occupies many pages. [.book-title]#The Diary of Thomas Burton# will also afford ample details as to
what passed in the House of Commons respecting his case.
Burton was a member of the House, and was mostly present, it seems,
during these proceedings.^
footnote:[Among the many speeches given in abstract by Burton,
during the protracted debates on James Nayler`'s case,
that of Lord Lambert may here be quoted, as almost the only one worthy of notice:
the whole picture as regards the temper and proceedings
of the House of Commons on this occasion,
presents a strange and humiliating view of the character of that assembly,
and of the spirit of the age.
Lambert was a member of Cromwell`'s council, a general in his army,

We parted with him with great regret.
He was a man of a very unblameable life and conduct;

[.salutation]
Dear Sister,

My dear love salutes you and the rest of your family, and all the faithful thereabouts.

I have been in the east counties, Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk;
where the service of the Lord is great, and the labourers are few.
And as the travail is great, so is the reward; which is,
his power and presence to accompany his work.
At present I am come up again to London;
but it is like I shall not stay long in the city,
but pass into the west to Bristol and South Wales, if the Lord will.

James Nayler is here at London; he and the women are kept as prisoners at an inn,
and have been twice called before a Committee of Parliament-men,^
footnote:[It consisted of fifty-five members,
and among them most of the law officers of the Commonwealth.]
and examined whether he would own that James Nayler was Christ;
but he kept them out of all occasions against him,
saying he denied James Nayler to be Christ, but Christ was in him.
There has been several times some of the Parliament-men
come to the place where they are kept prisoners,
questioning him about such things as were acted by him and the women,
in their witnessing him to be so;
but he sometimes put them off without giving them a full answer,
and left them unsatisfied.
Upon sixth-day last, I was with James.
That power of darkness in the women rules over him, as I wrote to you at the first.

Many people come daily to them, both of the world, and also such as are convinced;
and they wonder at the imitations which are acted among them;
as they often will kneel before him, etc.
James speaks pretty much to Friends as in justifying all their actings to be in innocency.
I was moved to speak unto him when I was with him,
but he was not willing to hear me open the truth of anything to the people.
My heart was made to pity his condition;
but all the counsel of the brethren to him is contemned
in the present state in which he is,
though hearts full of tenderness have been +++[+++extended--__word not clear__]
towards him.

Some that are unstable think that there is a great power among them;
but though as a cloud it darkens some at the present,--being
risen out of the earth,--at the end of the days of limitation,
it will fall to the earth again; and the sun will shine over it:
and the children will receive power of the Son to reign over all deceit.
This I have written, to let you understand something of his condition as it is:--^
footnote:[Among the Swarthmore collection of letters,
was found the following address from George Fox to James Nayler about this time:--it
is endorsed by George Fox thus:--"`G. F. to James Nayler--1656.`" And at foot is a
memorandum in the same hand-writing as that of the letter--"`This is a copy of the letter
that was found about him when he was examined.`"

{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`James, you must bear your own burden and your company`'s with you;
whose iniquity does increase, and by you is not cried against.
You have satisfied the world, yes, their desires which they looked for.
You and your disciples, and the world are joined against the Truth,
it is manifest through your willfulness and stubbornness;
and this is the word of the Lord of God to you.--Many did
not expect that you would have been an encourager of such,
as do cry against the power and life of Truth, but would have been a nourisher of Truth,
and not have trained up a company against it.

Therefore consider, and search yourself, if this be in innocency.

It would seem that Cromwell was in doubt,
as to the tendency of the proceedings and sentence of the House of Commons
in the case of James Nayler, by the following letter copied from a volume of MSS.

yet we being entrusted with the present government
on behalf of the people of these nations,

In [.book-title]#Burton`'s Diary,# vol. i., p. 246,

on the Speaker`'s reading the above letter;
the narrative is curious;--not a few of the members seem to confess
to the unwarrantable (if not illegal) stretch of the authority
of the House in its proceedings and sentence against James Nayler.
The debate on the Protector`'s letter is continued by adjournments from
time to time;--the House in fact seems unable to give a fair "`account
of the grounds and reasons whereupon they proceeded to such sentence.`"
Several members urge the appointment of a committee to prepare and answer to the Protector:
at length, on the matter being specially adjourned for the order of a future day,
"`the business of the day, that is, an answer to the letter,`" becomes,
(as Burton writes,) "`jostled out; and nobody said a word to it.
I hear +++[+++he adds+++]+++
it will never be mentioned again; if it be, I dread the consequence.`"
This interesting parliamentary Diarist then goes
on:--"`I wrote nothing this day in the House.
A friend told me that it would be taken notice of:
he heard it much talked on the day before.
Colonel +++_______+++ told me a week since, that +++_______+++ had a purpose to take me down.`"
Burton however,
does not drop his _note-book_ in consequence.+++*+++

[.salutation]
Dear Brother,

Friends here are well, and in good order, growing into the love and life of Truth,
and feeling the virtue and power of it in them; and the meetings are pretty quiet.
Friends in New England are well, and those that were prisoners at Boston are set free,
and are passing several ways,--some to Barbados.
William Ames is come out of Holland, and this day is passed towards Bristol;
and he intends shortly to come northward to you.

This week did the mayor, aldermen, and common councilmen of this city go up to Whitehall,
to Oliver; and he made a speech among them, concerning the danger of enemies,
and of Charles being ready in Flanders to come over with an army into England:
and in his declaration,
he spoke more against Friends than ever before he formerly expressed; saying,
that there was a good law made against the Quakers,
and they did well to put it in execution, and he would stand by them; for, he said,
they were against both magistracy and ministry.
So he and they are all hardened against the Truth;
and all their pretences of setting Friends at liberty, which they were once about,
are now ceased; and they are only plotting how to exalt themselves in the earth.

Francis Howgill is yet in Essex or that way.
There is great service in and about this city.

[.signed-section-closing]
Friends`' love here is dear unto you.

[.offset]
+++[+++_From the original._]

+++[+++It appears from [.book-title]#Burton`'s Diary,#
that after the passing of the cruel sentence upon James Nayler,
the House of Commons proceeded to receive several petitions against the Quakers,
presented from various parts of the country; upon which a debate ensued,
and the petitions were referred to the same committee which sat on James Nayler`'s case,
to report upon "`a bill to suppress the mischief.`"
In the course of this debate many members urge "`some
speedy course to be taken against`" this people:
one says, "`the sect is dangerous, their increase numerous,
prevention very necessary;`" several others inform the House that
they are growing very numerous in various parts of the country;
the M. P. for Cumberland states,
that "`they meet in multitudes, and upon moors in _terrorem populi,_`"
+++[+++to the terror of people!] another +++[+++the M. P. for Devonshire,]
"`that they meet in thousands in our county, and certainly will overrun all,
both ministers and magistrates.
I desire that you will make no delay in this business:
before long it will be too late to make a law.`"
There is no doubt, but that in consequence of James Nayler`'s affair,
and the grave cognizance taken of it by the House of Commons,
a strong public prejudice was unjustly imbibed against the Friends of that day,
though in no way implicated in, or answerable for James Nayler`'s offence.

The Parliament, however, proceeded with a bill against vagrants,
which was so expressed as to be capable of being readily used against Friends.
This is probably the law alluded to above by the Protector;
which enacted that every idle person "`vagrant from his usual place
of living or abode,`" and who "`shall not have such good and sufficient
cause or business for such his travelling or wandering,
as the justices or justice of peace, mayors, etc.,
before whom such person or persons shall be brought,
shall approve of,`" shall be proceeded against and punished as a rogue, etc.

They brought a high priest to him--as his letter expresses,--and many went with him,

[.salutation]
My Dear Sister Margaret Fell,

The Lord is ministering to many, an entrance into the everlasting Truth,
and is gathering into the life of it; and the Truth is secretly working.
I have passed through Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk, and was about five weeks in them,
in great service.
Then I was moved to come up to London; and something was upon me for Oliver Cromwell,
to whom I have already written.
Some sufferings of Friends have been laid before him lately, which are so cruel,
that he is much offended with those justices that caused it,
and promises to do something.

Here are many in this city daily convinced, and the Truth grows.
Last first-day, there were five of Fleetwood`'s family^
footnote:[Fleetwood was Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1657,
and a member of Cromwell`'s council; he married a daughter of the Protector.]
at the meeting at Worcester House; and the Truth spreads and gets dominion,
and Friends grow into feeling of the power of it.
I have been with James Nayler three times since I came; he is loving,
and his love does increase;
and he feels refreshment from those that be in the life and power of Truth.^
footnote:[In [.book-title]#Nichol`'s State Papers,#
(p.143) is a letter addressed to Cromwell from a William Malyn, dated August, 1668,
from which the following is extracted:--it is not improbable that there
was some intention on the part of Cromwell to have discharged James Nayler;
but he died on the third of the month following that of the date of this letter:
James Nayler was released by Parliament after the death of Cromwell.
With regard to James Nayler`'s taciturnity, as mentioned in this letter;
it is probable it was most to the peace of his own mind to maintain silence
towards those "`of the world,`" who intruded themselves upon him.
The writer of the letter seems not a little mistaken in his opinion of James Nayler`'s
state.
{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`I went this morning to Bridewell to see James Nayler.
I found him in his bed,
and sitting up with his head on a pillow (J. N. had been ill) I sat by him a good while,
and told him upon what account I came to see how he was,
and whether he desired anything to be done to him or for him.
He would not speak a word though often pressed thereto by myself and those that stood by.
I also withdrew for some time and came to him again, and asked him,
if he were free to have any discourse with me,
or if he had anything to desire that I should acquaint your Highness with,
but by all that I could do, I could not get a word from him.--It being near sermon time,
I left him, and went to Paul`'s +++[+++the author of the letter.+++]+++
After sermon I spoke with my Lord Packe,
(my Lord Titchbourne and my Lord Barkstead being by,) and
gave my Lord Packe an account of what I had done,
and my Lord Packe told me that he did intent tomorrow to wait on your Highness,
to give your Highness a particular account of James Nayler.
{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`Truly, my Lord, I look upon him to be under a resolved sullenness,
and I doubt in the height of pride.--I hope I should not go about
to dissuade your Highness from a work of tenderness and mercy,
which is pleasing to God; which we have reasons and objects enough for,
without doing that which may offend God, through lack of zeal for his glory and honour,
against such horrible impieties.

"`Truly, my Lord, in this case I conceive there is more need of watchfulness,
that we do not offend on that head,

footnote:[In another letter of Richard Hubberthorne to George Fox, in this year, 1657,
he says in a postscript, after speaking of his own services in Kent,
"`I was twice with John Lilburne: he is zealous and forward for the Truth:
he has a sight and comprehension, which is deep: he sees that the Truth comprehends all,
and he has a love unto it, and a desire to attain to it.`"
It appears from a work called [.book-title]#Cromwelliana,#
that John Lilburne died in the autumn of this year, at Eltham, in Kent;
and his corpse was removed from there to London, "`to the house called Mouth,
in Aldersgate, which is the usual meeting place of the people called Quakers,
to whom (it seems) he had lately joined in opinion:`"--it
was afterwards conveyed "`to Moorfields,
and buried in a burial ground near Bedlam.`"]

+++[+++The foregoing letters with the two following, which allude to James Nayler,
both as regards his fall and his recovery into fellowship with his brethren,
and afterwards--as we shall see--his return to gospel service,
are very interesting and instructive in several respects.
The following observations are taken from a work, published by Joseph Wyeth, in 1699:
"`James Nayler was a man who had been highly favoured of God,
with a good degree of grace, which was sufficient for him, had he kept to its teaching;
for while he did so, he was exemplary in godliness and great humility.
He was powerful in word and doctrine,
and thereby instrumental in the hand of God for turning many from darkness to light,
and from the power of Satan to the power of God.

"`But he, poor man, became exalted above measure, through the abundance of revelations;
and in that exaltation did depart from the grace and holy Spirit of God,
which had been his sufficient teacher.
Then blindness came over him,
and he allowed himself to be accounted of above what he ought.
Here he slipped and fell, but not irrecoverably;
for it did please God of his infinite mercy, in the day of his affliction,
to give him a sight and sense of his out-goings, and also a place of repentance.
And he, with the prodigal, humbled himself for his transgressions;
and besought God with true contrition of soul,
to pardon his offences through Jesus Christ.
God, I firmly believe, forgave him: for he pardons the truly penitent.

"`His people received him with great joy; for that he, who had gone astray from God,
was now returned to the Father`'s house; and for that he,
who had separated himself from them through his iniquity,
was now through repentance and forsaking of it,
returned into the unity of the faith and their holy fellowship
in the gospel of Christ.--Here let none insult,
but take heed lest they also, in the hour of temptation, do fall away.`"--Joseph Wyeth, [.book-title]#Switch for the Snake,# etc.]

[.salutation]
My Dearly Beloved Sister,

I have been with James Nayler in the prison three times since I came to this city,
and true love and life are springing up in him; he is made willing to lie under all,
and would do anything that might in the wisdom of God be seen convenient,
for taking off all occasions, as much as in him lies,
either by public recantation--which I do not judge serviceable--for exalting the Truth,
or any other way; he is made willing to bear all, and to come under all,
and has passed through true judgment.
James has written a few words with much subjection, desiring to be reconciled;
and I know that George Fox is dearer to him than ever, as by his words I have heard.

My dear sister, as you have been tender and of large compassion unto the sufferers,
I beseech you make intercession for him; that in the spirit of meekness, as a brother,
he may be restored again.
I am plain unto you, having no other thing in my heart,
but the glory and advancement of the Truth in this thing,
and peace and unity among brethren.
I know it lies on George Fox.--In patience I shall
wait to see the Truth advanced over all;
for I have great hopes that all things will be well.

Your dear brother in the fellowship of the gospel,

Dearly beloved Sister,

You are often in my remembrance, and my heart is to see you when God wills;
in whose counsel and life I desire to walk, to his praise alone,
who has thus far redeemed me out of deep adversity;
and does still work with me and for me,--as I abide in his patience and obedience,
making my way through many oppositions and trials.
In his will alone I desire to rest and be still;
who in the needful time has still appeared;--praises to Him forever!

I suppose you may have heard of my going to see our beloved George Fox at Reading,
which in tenderness of love I did, as soon as I was got out of prison,
hearing he was not well:^
footnote:[See [.book-title]#George Fox`'s Journal# under date 1658.]
but I was not permitted to come where he was; which my adversary rejoiced at,
that thereby he might add sorrow to affliction:--but my spirit was quieted,
in that simplicity in which I went, in that to return: and He gave me His peace therein,
as though I had had my desire,--blessed be the Lord God of my mercy for this thing;
who still becomes my peace, and his presence is with me in what He moves me to,
which is my comfort and refreshment,--and so His will is my peace.

My dear love to you and to your family, and all faithful Friends with you:
I am refreshed when I feel you near me, or hear from you,
in that in which we cannot be separated.

Dear Sister,

With my dear brethren and sisters, in the tender love of God I salute you all,
who in the measure of the Spirit of Jesus are united,
as living members of the body unto Christ the head.

Dearly beloved,
the work of the Lord goes on in power and in the authority of the Almighty,
which reigns over the heads of the wicked.
The Lord is gathering in many in this city daily; there are many meetings,
full and large, where there is any to declare the Truth among them:
and they that are great in the earth, the power of Truth strives through them,
and is drawing them in daily.
The priests confess that there is such a power among us,
that none who come to us can escape; and they exhort people not to come to us.
The last first-day I was at the Bull and Mouth,
where there was a great and serviceable meeting:
and the after part of the day I was at Westminster, where there was a large meeting,
and many soldiers, who are pretty faithful in their measures.

James Nayler was at two meetings; and the afternoon he had a great meeting,
where many were convinced that had not come before,
as there is in every meeting a coming in daily.
This day, if the Lord will, I am to pass out of the city towards Dunstable,
to have a meeting tomorrow, where a Baptist teacher has promised to be,
and many people intending to be at it.
The next day I purpose to be at Justice Crook`'s,
and I expect to meet my brother George Fox this week.

2nd month--called April--1659.

+++[+++Our Friends, for several years previous to this period,
had put forth in print many sad narratives of persecutions and
sufferings of their members in various parts of the country,
on account of their religious testimonies: (See [.book-title]#Whiting`'s Catalogue,#
under [.book-title]#Sufferings.#) Warning addresses had also been written by Edward Burrough and others,
to the Protector Oliver Cromwell; yet it seems they were generally unavailing,
for he died, leaving the case of these suffering, innocent people unredressed.
Further exertions on the part of Friends to obtain relief were made about this time,
by application to the new Protector Richard Cromwell, as well as to the Parliament.
It appears that on the sixth-day of this month--called April--an address
was presented on behalf of Friends to the Speaker of the House of Commons,
entitled, "`To the Parliament of the Commonwealth of England,
being a declaration of the names, places,
and sufferings of such as are now in prison for speaking the truth in several places;
for not paying tithes--for meeting together in the fear of God--for not swearing--for
wearing their hats--for being accounted as vagrants--for visiting Friends,
and for things of the like nature--in all about 144:--Besides,
imprisoned and persecuted till death, twenty-one.
Also a brief narrative of their sufferings within the last six years or thereabouts,
of about 1960 persons already returned; being but part of many more,
whose names and sufferings are not yet returned:
all which it is desired may be read and considered of by this Parliament,
that right may be done.`"
Then follows a list of cases of sufferings, arranged under the several counties,
and comprised in many pages.

This declaration seems to have laid dormant in the House for a time:
at length Friends came forward once more,
with the following address to the House of Commons,
an appeal calculated--one might suppose--to move the hardest of hearts.
This address is printed at large in [.book-title]#Besse`'s Sufferings;#
it is truly a remarkable document, and is well deserving, the editor thinks,
of a place in these historical notices relating to our Society.
A considerable number of Friends,
probably all whose names are subscribed to the document,
attended at the avenues of the House on the occasion.]

[.blurb]
=== From [.book-title]#Besse`'s Sufferings, (Fol.) Preface.#

There was a printed paper presented to the Parliament in 1659,
and subscribed by one hundred and sixty-four of this people;
wherein they make an offer of their own bodies, person for person,
to lie in prison instead of such of their brethren as were then under confinement,
and might be in danger of their lives through extreme durance,
which paper was as follows:

[.salutation]
Friends,

Who are called a Parliament of these Nations:
we in love to our brethren that lie in prisons, and houses of Correction, and dungeons,
and many in fetters and irons, and have been cruelly beat by the cruel jailers,
and many have been persecuted to death, and have died in prison,
and many lie sick and weak in prison, and on straw;
so we in love to our brethren do offer up our bodies and selves to you,
for to put us as lambs into the same dungeons, and houses of Correction, and their straw,
and nasty holes and prisons;
and do stand ready a sacrifice for to go into their places in love to our brethren,
that they may go forth, and that they may not die in prison,
as many of the brethren are dead already:
for we are willing to lay down our lives for our brethren,
and to take their sufferings upon us, which you would inflict upon them.
For if our brethren suffer, we cannot but feel it: and Christ says,
It is he that suffers and was not visited.
This is our love towards God and Christ, and our brethren,
that we owe to them and our enemies,
who are lovers of all your souls and your eternal good.

And if you will receive our bodies,
which we freely tender to you for our Friends that are now in prison,
for speaking the Truth in several places,
for not paying tithes--for meeting together in the fear of God--for not swearing--for
wearing their hats--for being accounted as vagrants--for visiting Friends,
and for things of the like nature, according to a paper entitled, [.book-title]#A Declaration to the Parliament,# etc. delivered the 6th day of the 2nd month,
called April, 1659, to the then Speaker of the said House:
We whose names are hereunto subscribed--being a sufficient number to answer for the
present sufferers,--are waiting in Westminster-hall for an answer from you to us,
to answer our tenders, and to manifest our love to our Friends,
and to stop the wrath and judgment from coming upon our enemies.

footnote:[From the [.book-title]#Mercurius Politicus,# a news book of that period, +++[+++_British Museum_+++]+++
the following public notice of this occurrence is given forth:--
{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`1659. Friday April 15.--This day and the following,
a great number of a sort of people called Quakers, came up to London from several parts,
and assembled themselves in Westminster Hall,
with the intent to represent something to the House touching the men of their way.
{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`Saturday, 16th April.--A paper written on the outside thereof with these words, namely,
"`For the Speaker of the Commons assembled in Parliament,
these are for him to read to the House of Commons,`" was this day read.
And upon the reading thereof, the same, among other things,
referred to another paper entitled [.book-title]#A Declaration to Parliament,#
etc. delivered the 6th day of the 2nd Month called April, 1659,
to the then Speaker of the House.
The said papers were presented by certain persons commonly called Quakers.`"
{footnote-paragraph-split}
A brief account of what passed in the House on this occasion,
drawn up from [.book-title]#Burton`'s Diary,# and from the [.book-title]#Journals of the House,#
is subjoined.
{footnote-paragraph-split}
One of the Members opened the business by the following remarks:--
{footnote-paragraph-split}
_Col. Grosvenor._ "`I took notice of a great number of people called
Quakers in the Hall yesterday and today.
I wish you would take some course with the Petition that has laid a long time before you;
and that they be dispersed.`"
Another member moved that they be whipped home as vagrants.
The petition was at length read.
Several members then made a variety of remarks; several are against them,
or the release of their imprisoned brethren;
others were for referring their grievances to a committee; another,
that the county members should refer their case to
the justices to inquire into their grievances.
At length the House resolves,
"`That the answer to be given to the persons that presented the paper is,
that this House has read their paper, and the paper thereby referred to;
and does declare their dislike of the scandal thereby cast upon magistracy and ministry;
and does therefore order, that they and other persons concerned,
do forthwith resort to their respective habitations,
and there apply themselves to their callings,
and submit themselves to the laws of the nation, and the magistracy they live under.`"
It was moved that two or three of them be called in.
From the Journals of the House, "`16th April,`" it appears, "`that Thomas Moor,
John Crook,
and Edward Byllyng were brought in to the bar,`"
the Sergeant having taken off their hats,
and the aforesaid answer was declared to them by the Speaker.]

--

+++[+++Although little or no apparent effect appeared to be produced
at the time in the House from the foregoing affecting appeal,
we may notice by the [.book-title]#Journals of the Commons,#
that in the month following a committee was appointed,
"`to consider of the imprisonment of such persons
who continue committed for conscience sake,
and how and in what manner they are and continue committed,
together with the whole cause thereof, and how they may be discharged;
and to report the same to the Parliament.`"
([.book-title]#Journals# under 10th of May, 1659.) Of this committee the Earl of Pembroke and Vane,
(names mentioned in these letters) were members.

Ever Dear and Truly Beloved Sister,

Though for sometime I have been silent, yet my dear and true love is unto you,
and my heart is knit unto you in an inseparable bond.
My love is enlarged towards you all; and though in body I be absent from you,
yet in the Lord I am present with you.
Oh! how good and precious a thing it is to be kept in the love of Truth:
the Lord strengthen and preserve all his, faithful unto the end.

Things in this city generally are well, and Truth is of good dominion:
and truly this I may say, that never, since I knew the Truth, was the service greater;
a mighty thirst, and desire, and openness are in many people in most places,
especially since the change of the government; and the work is very great, and labourers,
who are true and faithful, are but few, as you well know: and this I see,
that the more we labour, the more work we have.
But the Lord is our strength, and willing I am to spend and be spent for the Lord`'s sake.

The committee of Parliament are most of them very moderate,
and examine things very fully;
and whether they do anything or nothing as to the enlargement of Friends,
it is serviceable that the wickedness of greedy and covetous men is brought to light.
Much cannot be expected of men in that nature; for though there be a change of name,
yet the old nature is still standing,--earth enough there is to make another mountain:
but whatever the consequence be, this I know and feel, that Truth has great advantage,
and an open door is further made for spreading the Truth abroad.
The Lord prosper his work, and carry it on to his own praise and glory.

George Fox and Edward Burrough came to this city on last fifth-day,
and much service they have had in Kent and other parts;
as for Edward Burrough`'s service in Dunkirk,
I leave it to his own declaration by his letters to Kendal.^
footnote:[See [.book-title]#Sewel# under date 1659; Edward Burrough was accompanied by Samuel Fisher.]
George Fox is well, as I. R. +++[+++Isabel Rouse (?)]
can inform you, who went out of this city the last week;
it is like she may be with you before the receipt of this.
My love is to her and to Bridget, Sarah^
footnote:[Isabel, Bridgett and Sarah, daughters of Margaret Fell.]
and the rest.
My love reaches unto you all, and Friends that way.

In dearness of love unto you,
I rest and remain your dear brother in the service of the Lord.

Dear Sister,

In the unfeigned love of the Truth I salute you;
and the dear love from the fountain of my life does freely
issue forth unto all the Lord`'s flock with you;
being dearly related unto them all in the spirit of love and life,
of which our heavenly Father has made us all partakers;
that we may feel and know and be refreshed in one another,--that our joy may be full.
The work is here increasing daily,
and meetings are now all over the city pretty peaceable from disturbance.
As for the officers of the army here,
they bring little forth that is good unto any perfection; they talk and debate of things,
but that is the most they do.

As for tithes they debate about them, sometimes talking of selling them;
and how to provide a maintenance for a ministry they are in great consultation:
sometimes they tell of reducing the 9,000 parishes in England into 3,000,
and so to have some certain ministers, who shall be the State`'s ministers,
and the State to pay them; and they spend their time in talking of such things.
But some of the heads of them are deceitful in pride and ambition,
and seek themselves and not the good of others;
though some of the inferiors have honest intents if they could bring them to pass.
I have been oftentimes with some of them, as Colonel Rich, Colonel Ashfield,
Henry Vane and others; they are pretty open to hear counsel,
and do profess to stand for good things.

Colonel Rich,^
footnote:[Colonel Rich was member of Parliament which sat in the spring of this year.]
has been very serviceable for Friends in this late committee,
and is bold to speak for truth and righteousness among them;
but he and Vane and the rest of those that would do something, are rejected;
and the chief leaders among them dare not bring anything to vote,
because that the general part of the inferior officers
would have liberty and honest things.
Colonel Rich declared among them,
how that many of our Friends were in prison again since the Parliament was dissolved;
and how that the Parliament had done more for the
liberty of tender consciences than they had done;
and he did move it to them to appoint a committee for the same purpose,
to free those that suffered for conscience sake; and many of them said it was good;
but they put it off, and would not do it.

I desire to hear from you as you find freedom in the Lord,

Margaret Fell my dearly beloved in the Lord, my soul greets you, and honours you.
George Fox and Friends here are generally well;
but General Monk`'s soldiers begin to be rude concerning Friends`' meetings.
John Scafe is come to town,
and went yesterday to the meeting in the Palace Yard at Westminster;
but soon after he began to speak, they began to pull Friends out of the house violently,
and beat them very sore, and would not permit any of them to stay in the house; indeed,
they beat and abused Friends exceedingly in the streets.
I came there when they had hailed almost all Friends out, and scattered them;
and they pulled me out and beat me much, and knocked me down in the street,
and tore all my coat.

Edward Billing and his wife were much abused, he especially.
I hear he went presently and wrote to the Parliament,
and acquainted some of them with their usage,
and that he would endeavour to lay it before General Monk and the rest.
Great distractions and disaffections there are in people, as things now stand;

+++[+++The following letter is transcribed from an ancient manuscript, probably a copy;
it is without date,
and is endorsed "`Edward Burrough`'s letter to W. M.`" The
contents of the letter are rather circumstantial,
and carry with them all the appearance of authenticity.
As regards the date, it may be observed, that the preceding letter of Henry Fell,
which alludes to the same circumstances, decides the period at which it was written;
and the following quotation from the [.book-title]#Diary of Samuel Pepys,#
seems to fix the date of the letter,
and perhaps even the name of its writer:--Edward Billing.

To the Hall +++[+++Westminster;]
when in the Palace Yard, I saw Monk`'s soldiers abuse Billing and all the Quakers,
that were at a meeting place there: and indeed the soldiers did use them very roughly,
and were to blame.`"--[.book-title]#Diary of S. Pepys,# vol. i. p. 13.]

Edward Burrough to W. M.

[.salutation]
Dear W. M.,

Oh! my dear heart, forever blessed be His eternal name, who has called us,
and thought us worthy to testify,
or in any measure to suffer for his name`'s sake who is, and was, and is to come,
and is already come, and who is over all!

Since general Monk`'s coming to London with his army,
we have been very much abused in our meetings; as in the Palace Yard,
we were pulled out by the hair of the head, kicked, and knocked down, both men and women,
in such a manner not here to be expressed.
Many were the knocks, and blows, and kicks, myself and wife received;
and this was done by General Monk`'s foot,
who came into the meeting with sword and pistol, being, as they said,
bound by an oath to leave never a sectarian in England; saying,
that they had order from their lord Monk, to pull us out of our meeting;
which with inexpressible cruelty they did.
The meeting in the Palace Yard I suppose you know.

After they had beat us in the house with their swords in their scabbards, whips,
and such like, out they drag and kicked us into the kennel before the door,
where many a blow I received, being in particular knocked and kicked,
quite through the Palace Yard, even to the Hall door.
Being got within the Hall, after a little recovery,
I was moved of the Lord to write a little note to the Speaker
in the House,--Parliament being then sitting.
So soon as I got into the lobby, I sent into the House for Sergeant Chidleton,
who came to me, and I gave him the note, laying it upon him to give it to the Speaker,
which he did, and it was forthwith read in the House, publicly;
when an enemy stands up and says, the multitude were appeased, etc.
I passed through the multitude back again to the meetinghouse,
when they again fell upon me the second time, as before;
and in my passing back to my own lodging, they spared me not, but fell upon me, crying,
"`Kill him,`" saying, I was the ringleader and captain of the rogues.

We afterwards met Colonel Rich, who was much affected to see and hear of our usage;
with whom I passed through the Palace Yard again,
the soldiers and multitude being just then beating a woman
of the house at the door and plundering the house,
notwithstanding it had been said that the tumult was appeased.
At last I passed to Whitehall, where General Monk was; with whom I had present audience:
in a few words, I laid the whole matter before him, and told him that the soldiers said,
they had his order for it.
He might say, they had not.
I answered, that since he and his army had come to town,
we could not pass the streets without very much abuse;
having been not so much abused these many years, no, I say, never by soldiers.
I do not give you this ample account of my abuse, as if it were greater than others;
for several Friends were as badly used as myself.
So Friends in New England are executed:^
footnote:['`27th October, 1659.`' [.book-title]#Gough`'s History.#]
the third upon the ladder bore a precious testimony for the living God.

The Parliament have declared that the priests`' maintenance shall be by way of tithes;
and that they will govern according to law.
Till now, they pretended to regulate the law at the least,
and that the priest should have his tithes till another maintenance could be found;
but those in the House who had any reasonableness in them, before their interruption,
are now become as bad as men can well be; except N. Rich, Henry Smith, F. Pirne,
+++[+++or Prynne]
and Pembroke, +++[+++_probably_ Earl of]
who was the only person who moved for liberty of conscience;
being not seconded by one man,--N. R. not being there,--closing
his speech with these words,
"`Mr. Speaker, I suppose what I have offered to you,
will be but as a cup of cold water.`"

General Monk has broke down the gates of London,
which--it is like--was beyond his judgment, to which--it is said--he was, as it were,
betrayed;
for saying merrily at the council one night,--it is said,--that
the city would not be conformable till the gates were pulled down,
or the like,
Haslerig went to the House on the morrow and informed
the House it was General Monk`'s desire,
the council having sent him an order the night before to do it:
but upon Arthur Haslerig`'s report,
it was confirmed.--After all this he marches out of the city to Whitehall,
and brings his army back with him.
The next day he calls a council of his own officers distinct,
and into the city he marches again with his army, without the consent of the Parliament;
but they were forced to be quiet, and glad they could be so.

The city received him and his with great acclamation,--bells ringing,
and bonfires all the night, the like I believe has hardly been seen.
But for all this, to this day neither the city nor Parliament are certain of him.
He is now no more than one of the commissioners,
his commission as general being expired the 11th of this month:
yet he has sent for the Irish brigade by his own order, to march to him;
and he still continues in the city.
Writs and qualifications are ready for the filling up of the House, and it is said,
they are to go forth tomorrow:
but at present it is more like the secluded members will come in, the whole +++[+++country (?)]
is for them or a free Parliament.

Fairfax and the rest of the great ones in that county +++[+++York (?)],
have declared for the free Parliament or the secluded members;
without the one they declare to pay no taxes,
Norfolk and Suffolk are in association with them of Yorkshire,
and Wales is in the like posture: their regiments are formed or forming in Yorkshire.
Fast will God`'s hand be upon this Parliament,
as it was upon those unclean hypocrites at Wallington House;
who did what in them lay against God, and whatsoever might be called of God.
Lambert is not yet come in, according to the Parliament`'s order;
but has sent a letter to the Speaker, the purport whereof is,--as it is said--,
desiring to have their order to live quietly at home, or a pass to go beyond the seas.
Ludlow is impeached in the House; but as yet nothing is done against him,
and he sits in the House.
Sharp and terrible will the hour of persecution +++[+++?]
yet be.
As you have freedom, salute me dearly to Friends; and let such as stand,
take heed lest they fall; for I am confident we shall again be tried, so as by fire.

Henry Vane and Salway are secluded the House, and Salway committed to the Tower,
but has obtained favour to go to his own house in Oxfordshire.
Vane is committed to Raby Castle +++[+++_his own residence,_]
and is gone the second time; for he was upon his journey, and came back again;
at which General Monk took exceptions;
so he was again ordered into the hands of the Sergeant at Arms,
who conveyed him out of London some days since.
Fleetwood and those worst of men in combination with him, namely, Sydenham, Desborough,
Packer, and others, are only dismissed, and at the present connived at; and so is Owen.

Friends are in general preciously kept in the life; and I may truly say,
are refreshed in this hour of persecution.^

Dear Brother.

Since I wrote unto you last week, our meetings have been quiet and very full.
G+++.+++ F.--George Fox, Jr.--was brought up to this city the last week upon the fifth-day,
and is prisoner at Lambeth House, and Robert Grassingham, who was brought up with him;
they are not yet called, +++[+++summoned (?)]
but therein remain.^
footnote:[See a full account of this affair in [.book-title]#Sewel`'s History# under this date.]
I have been twice with them in prison: and I visited some officers of the army there,
with whom I had good service, as Major Brayman, Allen, and Courtney,
who are there prisoners: and Colonel Rich I have been with,--he is at liberty;
he is pretty low and sensible, and sees that all will be separated into two,--that is,
either to join to the truth, or to the profane:
he was the last first-day at our meeting in the Strand.
Several who have had an honest principle stirring in them,
begin to be bowed under towards the Truth; but the wickedness in this city is so great,
that it is past expression; and everywhere in the nation it abounds as a flood;
and Friends everywhere pass in the hazard of their lives and of great sufferings.
Stephen Crisp has passed through much suffering at Peterborough, Norwich,
and other places, and is now at Colchester.

John Moon and William Alan, have been sore abused at Cambridge,
and William Alan is sore bruised.
Josiah Coale is prisoner at Leicester, and put in the marshal`'s hands,
where he is very hardly used: he lies upon some stoles +++[+++stones (?)]
and his food is only bread and beer: he desired that you might know of it.
Alexander Parker is prisoner at Nantwich in Cheshire, and is in the marshal`'s hand;
he was taken out of a meeting at Northwich; but the marshal is pretty loving to him.
It is only the power of the Lord God,
that preserves us here in this city from the rage of the wicked, which is very high.
At our meeting this day at Westminster in the morning, the people were very rude,
and had almost broken the meeting; but afterwards some soldiers came,
and did quiet the rude people and set a guard at the door;
and so the meeting was kept quiet, and ended quiet.

This day did King Charles and his two brethren, James and Henry, come into this city:
Charles is of a pretty sober countenance;
but the great pride and vanity of those that brought him in, is inexpressible;
and he is in danger to be brought +++[+++or wrought]
to those things, which he in himself is not inclined unto.
The great excess and abomination that has been used this day in this city,
is inexpressible.^

Dear Brother,

As concerning what is done here, Margaret Fell has wrote to you.^
footnote:[It appears from [.book-title]#George Fox`'s Journal,# that Margaret Fell, about this time,
went to London, to intercede with the King on behalf of George Fox,
who had been taken a prisoner at her house,
and forcibly carried away to Lancaster Castle.
He was, not long afterwards, released by order of the King,
having been permitted on his word only,
to travel up to London to appear before the judges.
(See George Fox`'s Journal,
1660.)
{footnote-paragraph-split}
Margaret Fell also delivered a letter to the King,
with her own hands, in the 5th month of this year,
after he had issued a proclamation to bring to trial those
who were instrumental in taking away his father`'s life.
In this letter she reminds him how the Lord had brought him again into this nation,
without shedding of blood or revengings; she, therefore, wished him to consider this,
and not to look to those that would incense him to revenge,
which is not according to the will of God, nor good for the King; whose best way was,
to show mercy and forgiveness, and to commit his cause to God;
"`and to be clear of all men`'s blood,
and to let everyone enjoy the liberty of their consciences
to that worship they dare trust their souls under,`" etc.
She also addressed other letters to him about this period.--[.book-title]#Margaret Fell`'s Works.#]
Our meetings here are very full and quiet, and increase daily; and there is great service.
I showed James Nayler your letter,
wherein you mention a former letter concerning his going to Bishopric;
but he received none before: he does remember his dear love to you,
and does desire to hear from you by the next post,
whether anything of that be upon you concerning him.
But at present here is a great service for him,
and several great ones have a desire to hear him at Woodcock`'s;
he has been there some first-days, and it is upon him to be there yet more.
We have drawn some from that meeting, because it was so full,
and many that are great in the outward resort there.
There is a meeting at Elizabeth Trott`'s at Pall Mall, where many come in;
where Margaret Fell has been two first-days.^

In a register book of Yealand meeting in Lancashire,
was found a short account respecting Richard Hubberthorne,
who was a native of that village;
he is there described to be one of the first messengers
that declared the Truth in that part.
After stating that he was imprisoned some months in Chester jail,
the account proceeds to say,
that he was sent away from that city by the mayor and justices under warrant,
"`to be had from constable to constable till he came to Yealand,
the place of his nativity.
The first constable was Richard Sale of Oule, who by him was convinced:
he burned the warrant, and set him at liberty.`"^

of his torturing confinement in Chester jail,
in a cell called Little-ease: (See [.book-title]#Sewel`'s History#--Index Sale.)]
Richard Hubberthorne was afterwards imprisoned at Congleton;
also at Cambridge and at Norwich, and there remained several months.
Coming from there to London he "`had much exercise with many great ones,

So after much labour and travail in England and Wales for nine years,
he was imprisoned by Richard Brown,
a great persecutor--mayor of the city of London,--in Newgate prison;

Dear George Fox.--

As concerning the sufferings, they have been all sent up--except Scotland--long since;
about eighteen counties have sent up copies, which are done,
some in books and some in papers, in good order: most that are come,
are from Western counties.
Now the chief cause of my writing is, to know whether they should be printed,
or whether you would have them wrote in a great book for to be kept?
Now I am not so much employed, but that I may settle to write them, if you think fit,
which I am free to do: or whether you think Thomas Forster may do them,
who I believe would do them better?
yet I am very free, and may take as much care as I can, to do them well:
and for the placing of the counties, which shall be put first, it may be as you orders.
There is only Lincolnshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire,
sent up as yet of the Northern counties; so, if you think necessary, they may be sent to,
to send them up.
My dear love is unto you.

My Dearly Beloved Lambs and Babes,

My love is to you all; and my prayer to the Lord is for you all,
that in his arm and power you may be kept in the bosom of his love,
there to be nursed and cherished up to eternal life.

George Fox is now freed,
blessed be the Lord God,--whose arm and power alone has done it,--after
he had appeared before the judge who sent for him up;
then he appeared before the Lord Chief Justice of England in his chamber;
and the next day he appeared before them all in open court, in the King`'s Bench;
and all this after the King had granted out an order to set him free:
but they would not set him free, till he had appeared in all these places,
to see if anything would come against him.
It was of great service for the Truth.^
footnote:[The judge`'s warrant for his discharge,
is dated on the day of the date of this letter,
and it is addressed to the marshal of the King`'s Bench:
George Fox was thus set at liberty after having been
a prisoner more than twenty weeks in Lancaster Castle.
He states in his [.book-title]#Journal,# that terror took hold of the justice of Lancashire (Porter),
by whom he had been committed, though innocent of any just charge:
"`he was afraid I would take the advantage of the law against him for my wrong imprisonment:--and
indeed I was pressed by some in authority to make him and the rest examples;
but I said I should leave them to the Lord; if the Lord forgave them,
I should not trouble myself with them.`"--[.book-title]#Journal,# 1660.]

I cannot write at present punctually the time of my return,
for I do feel that I am not +++[+++yet clear, _(torn)_]
of this place; but still do wait for the Lord`'s +++[+++will and _(torn)_]
pleasure and his time to be manifested to me: and +++[+++may _(torn)_]
you rest satisfied in that; for there is everlasting peace, and there you will enjoy me.
I do not know how suddenly the Lord may give me my freedom to come home; but when it is,
I shall embrace it lovingly.
Let me hear of the little ones, how it is with them all,
(you mention little of them when you write;) and my desire is to hear of you all,
and of your wellbeing in the Lord.
It may be you have heard before this, that James Nayler has finished his natural life,
and has laid down his body of earth about three-score miles off London.^
footnote:[James Nayler died in Huntingdonshire;
the following is a copy of the burial register of Friends in Huntingdonshire:
"`James Nayler, buried 21st of 8th month, 1660, at Ripton Regis, in Huntingdonshire.`"]

So no more, but my love in the Lord Jesus is with you;
and as soon as the Lord gives me leave, I shall return.
The eternal arm of the Almighty be with you.

+++[+++Towards the latter part of this year,
(1660,) Friends in London were very assiduous in interceding
with the King on behalf of their suffering brethren,
so many of whom were enduring grievous confinement in the prisons of the country.
George Whitehead informs us;--"`Their innocency was pleaded before him, +++[+++the King,]
as being a peaceable people,
and not having forfeited their interest in his promise
of liberty to tender consciences in matters of religion:
some of our Friends at London reminded him thereof;
and by solicitations and frequent complaints of our persecutions and hardships,
he +++[+++the King]
was induced to issue his proclamation of grace, for our releasement out of the prisons.
Howbeit, the said proclamation also contained a menace or threat in it,
that impunity was not intended us, if we continued to practice as we had done,
i+++.+++ e. upon the score of religion.`"^
footnote:[The following is a copy of the minute of the Council
Board respecting Friend`'s complaints:

being present, that the Lord Steward, +++[+++with six other members of the Board+++]+++
or any three of them,
be a Committee to consider of the papers and addresses of the Quakers;
and to prepare such a proclamation of declaration thereupon,
as they shall think fit to be offered to the King concerning them; as also to examine,
where any of the said persons are imprisoned, for what causes they were committed,
what times they have been under restraint,
and what will be fit to be done for their enlargement;
and hereof to make report to the Board.`"
The business being followed up, a Royal Proclamation was prepared and issued;
from which the following in an extract:
{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`January 25th, 1661. +++[+++11th month 1660+++]+++
Whereas very many persons, commonly known by the name and appellation of Quakers,
have been lately taken and imprisoned as persons opposite to the King`'s government;
the King was graciously pleased to order in Council,
that the Lord Mayor of the City of London should release all, or so many of them,
now prisoners within his liberties, as are not ringleaders or preachers among them,
or have not any particular charge against them; they,
the said Quakers engaging themselves henceforward to live
obediently according to law.`"--[.book-title]#Kennet`'s Chronicle,# p. 318 and 364.]--[.book-title]#Christian Progress.# p. 260.

It should be stated,
that about this period endeavours appear to have been used
to reconcile ecclesiastical differences in the State generally;
for a Royal declaration was issued from the Council, dated 25th of October, 1660,
+++[+++8th month,]
"`concerning ecclesiastical affairs,`" in which the
King expresses his desire to compose those differences,
and to remove abuses.
In this document,
he again renews what he formerly proclaimed in his [.book-title]#Declaration from Breda#
for the liberty of tender consciences,--"`that no man should be disquieted
or called in question for differences of opinion in matters of religion,
which do not disturb the peace of the Kingdom.`"--[.book-title]#Royal
Declaration Concerning Ecclesiastical Affairs,
etc.--Lord Somers`' Tracts,# vol. xi. p. 16.^
footnote:[So far did matters appear about this time
to turn in favour of general liberty of conscience,
that the above Royal declaration was even embodied into a Bill,
which was brought into the House of Commons the 28th of November, +++[+++9th month+++]+++
of this year 1660; but it was negatived on the second reading,
being opposed by one of the King`'s Secretaries of State;
such was the uncertainty or vacillation (if no worse,) displayed in this important object.
But plots arose soon after, and most especially that of the Fifth Monarchy men,
which put an end to all further proceedings or professions for general liberty of conscience;
and most probably those plots were made the pretext for the adoption,
in the course of the next year, of the severe measures against non-conformists,
and chiefly against Friends.]

In [.book-title]#Sewel`'s History# will be found some interesting
particulars of what passed during an interview,
which Richard Hubberthorne had with the King about this time.
George Fox also mentions in his [.book-title]#Journal,#
that Thomas Moore and Margaret Fell were often engaged
to intercede with the King on the same account.

Among the Swarthmore Collection of M. S. S. has been found the following
narrative of an interview had by Thomas Moore with the King,
which it is believed has not been before printed: it is endorsed by George Fox,
"`What the King said to Thomas Moore.
1660, 14th of tenth month.`"^
footnote:[Respecting Thomas Moore, George Fox, in his Journal writes; "`At Reigate,
Friends told me of one Thomas Moore, a justice of the peace,
that lived not far from Reigate, and was a friendly moderate man:
whereupon I went to visit him at his house,
and he came to be a serviceable man in the Truth.`"

=== Something That Passed Between the King and Me, Thomas Moore Of Hartswood, in the County of Surrey.

[.signed-section-context-open]
14th of 10th month +++[+++12th month]
1660.

After that I, with other Friends,
had presented our sufferings to the King and several particular members of his council,
and after several days waiting upon them for answer, the King was pleased,
with a great part of his council, to grant us an order;
and chose a committee to examine our papers and sufferings.
After some weeks that we had waited and solicited
those members who were chosen to hear our business,
we had many promises from them that we should be heard, and likewise have relief.
So upon the aforesaid day of the 10th month, we being, as our manner was,
waiting in the lobby at the council chamber door,
the King and his whole Council being there sat, (as we have heard since,
by some of them that were of the Council;) there was a debate
among them whether I should be called in with my hat on,
for they said I would not take it off myself;
others said it might be taken off gently by the doorkeeper, or the clerk:
but the King said, by no means, it should not be taken off, except I took it off myself;
none other should take it off.

Whereupon after some time I was called in;
and when I had come a decent way into the room,
and saw the King at the head of the table with the rest of the Council, I made a stop,
not knowing but that I might give offence: when one of the Council spoke to me and said,
"`you may go up; it is the King`'s pleasure that you may come to him with your hat on.`"
So I went up near to the king, and said, "`Is this the King?`"
And they said, "`Yes.`"
I looked upon him, and he upon me;
and I spoke the word of the Lord to him as it rose in me,--concerning the goodness
and the mercy of the Lord to him,--for the space of a quarter of an hour,
and was not interrupted; but they were all silent, till I was clear.

When I had done speaking, the King asked me what I would have of him.
I said, "`O King, our meetings, which are kept in God`'s fear,
are by the will of evil rulers and rude people, many times broken up,--we are hailed,
beaten, bruised, and trod upon by the said people;
who are countenanced by such magistrates,
who in their wills cause us many times to be haled out, sent to prison,
and kept there contrary to law and your declaration sent from Breda, and since revived;
in which you did promise we should not be disturbed, nor called in question,
for things pertaining to our consciences.`"

Then the King answered me; "`God forbid, you, living in God`'s fear, should be wronged,
and that your meetings should be disturbed;
for it is my mind that you should enjoy your meetings peaceably, and be protected,
living peaceably and quietly in the kingdom.`"
Then I said, "`Some of us are indicted for not coming to the steeple-house.`"
The King answered, "`You shall not be indicted for not coming to the church.`"
Then I said, "`What you speak here within these walls, may not relieve us;
for the magistrates in the kingdom may not take notice what your mind is here,
and so possibly we may not enjoy what is in your heart towards us,
except your pleasure be signified to the kingdom by proclamation, or declaration.`"
To which the King answered, "`You shall enjoy your meetings without disturbance,
you shall see it, so long as you live peaceably; leave it to me.`"

By what the King said there, we do expect that something may be done for us;
for he bade us stay awhile, and we should see.

+++[+++George Fox, in his [.book-title]#Journal# under date about this period, says,
"`There seemed at this time an inclination and intention
in the government to grant Friends liberty;
because they were sensible that we had suffered, as well as they,
under the former powers.
But still, when anything was going forward in order thereto, some dirty spirit or other,
that would seem to be for us, threw something in the way to stop it.
It was said, there was an instrument drawn up for confirming our liberty,
and that it only needed signing; when on a sudden,
that wicked attempt of the Fifth Monarchy people broke out,
and put the city and nation in an uproar.`"

After this event,
George Fox and his Friends drew up [.book-title]#A Declaration From the
Harmless and Innocent People of God Called Quakers,
Against all Sedition, Plotters and Fighters in the World,# etc.,
which was presented to the King on the 21st of the 11th month,
1660 (called January 1661.)--His [.book-title]#Journal# may be consulted

[.letter-heading]
On the Proceedings in Parliament Respecting the Bill Against Friends in 1661.

+++[+++Notwithstanding the earnest solicitations of Friends with the King,
in the early part of this year (soon after the Fifth Monarchy plot) a
Royal proclamation was issued forth against "`all unlawful meetings under
pretence of religious worship;`" in which "`Quakers`" were expressly named;
setting forth that "`they do meet in great numbers, at unusual times, etc.,
by reason whereof they begin to boast of their multitudes and to increase in
their confidences,`" etc.--all such persons are to be bound over or imprisoned,
and the oath of allegiance tendered to them.--[.book-title]#Kennet,# p. 357.

On the 11th of the month, called May, of this year,
on the occasion of the King`'s coronation, another Royal proclamation was however issued,
to discharge such Friends who had been imprisoned under an Act of James 1st,
as well as for refusing the oath, or for meeting contrary to the late proclamation,
without the payment of fees.
But in five days only from the date of this proclamation,
(proving that there existed a strong party in the State in favour of persecution)
a committee was appointed in the House of Commons "`to prepare and bring
in a bill to prevent the ill consequences to the government,
by Quakers and others refusing to take oaths,
and numerously and unlawfully convening together;
with such penalties as may be suitable to the nature of those offences,
and may be profitable to work upon the humours of such fanatics.`"--[.book-title]#Kennet,# p. 448,
quoting from the [.book-title]#Commons Journals.#

George Whitehead writes as follows on the subject of this cruel bill,
which may be said to be the first attempt to crush the Society by all the force
of legislative enactment:--"`It was but a short time after we were set at liberty,
that we could enjoy our religious meetings quietly;
the irreligious persecuting spirit was at work in the nation among priests and magistrates,
who would have all compelled to go to church and conform,
(as the pretence was,) for all to be of one religion;
when there was but little of the life, substance,
or purity of religion designed in the case.--So hasty
and precipitant was the persecuting spirit,
and eager to be at work, and that too under some colour or pretence of law,
that in the first Parliament chosen after the King`'s restoration,
they soon contrived a bill for suppressing our meetings;
and several of the persons chosen to be members of that Parliament,
being known to be persecutors, that party swayed and carried it by vote;
in so much that the bill was committed, and at last passed into an act,
which is entitled: [.book-title]#An Act for Preventing Mischiefs and Dangers That May Arise by Certain
Persons Called Quakers and Others Refusing to Take Lawful Oaths.#

After setting forth that certain persons named Quakers, and others,
"`have taken up and maintained sundry dangerous opinions and tenets and, among others,
that the taking of an oath in any case whatsoever, although before a lawful magistrate,
is altogether unlawful,
and contrary to the word of God,`" etc. the act proceeds to state further,
that "`the said persons, under a pretence of religious worship,
do often assemble themselves in great numbers in several parts of this realm,
to the great endangering of the public peace and safety, and to the terror of the people,
by maintaining a secret and strict correspondence among themselves,
and in the meantime separating and dividing themselves
from the rest of his Majesty`'s good and lawful subjects,
and from the public congregations and usual places of divine worship;`"--it then enacts,
that if five or more Quakers, above sixteen years of age,
assemble under pretence of joining in religious worship not authorized by law,
"`the party convicted shall forfeit, for the first offence, not exceeding £5,
for the second £10, and in default of payment or distraint,
for the first offence to be imprisoned three months, for the second six months,
and for the third, transportation to any of the King`'s plantations.`"

George Whitehead then proceeds to give an account of the exertions of himself,
Edward Burrough, and Richard Hubberthorne, before the committee of Parliament,
in pleading against the bill: the particulars of what passed on the occasion,
as given by George Whitehead (in his [.book-title]#Christian Progress,# p. 262,
etc.) are well worthy of perusal,
but the whole account is too long to be introduced here.
He adds, "`Having not a particular or full account in writing,
what my friends Edward Burrough and Richard Hubberthorne declared to the committee,
I cannot insert the same with mine; but I remember,
the last time we were before the committee, Edward Burrough told them to this purport:
'`that if they made a law against our religious meetings,
he should esteem it his duty to exhort our Friends to keep their meetings diligently.`'`"

From a private collection of manuscripts,
containing many original letters of Edward Burrough, also ancient copies of his papers,
etc.,
the editor is able to supply Edward Burrough`'s narrative
of their proceedings upon this memorable occasion:
the account is somewhat more circumstantial than that of George Whitehead, and has not,
it is believed, been before published.
The torrent of persecution which burst forth against our Friends through the land,
after the passing of this bill against them,
and the noble stand they were enabled to make against it,
form a very remarkable portion of the history of our Society,
and render these detailed accounts particularly interesting.

[.blurb]
=== A Brief Account of the Proceedings of Parliament Concerning the People of God Called Quakers

According to the policy of the men of this world which works
in this generation against the righteous seed of God,
to subdue it, as ever it did in ages past against the same seed;--thus it came to pass.
The 26th day of the 3rd month last,
called May,--which was not many days after the Parliament came
together--it was moved by a certain member of the House of Commons,--whose
name I shall not now mention,--that whereas the Quakers,
as he called them, were a numerous people,
and growing more numerous daily,--and upon the King`'s
indulgence and fair promises towards them,
especially that proclamation for their release out of all prisons,--which was about
three days before that time come forth and published,--were very high and confident;
and they met together in great numbers, and were of dangerous consequence,
and prevailed much to the seducing of the King`'s subjects, etc., or to this effect:
that therefore that House would be pleased to take into consideration,
by what way and means to proceed for to check and restrain such their confidence;
and to enact something concerning their refusing to take oaths, and their great meetings;
or to this effect.
Whereupon it was put to the question in the House, and resolved upon the same,
that it should be referred to such persons--whom I shall not now nominate--as a committee,
to prepare and bring in a bill to prevent the ill consequence in government,
by the Quakers, Anabaptists and other schismatics, refusing to take oaths,
and numerously and unlawfully convening together,--with such penalties
as may be suitable to the nature of those offences,
and profitable to work upon the humours of such fanatics.
These be the very words of the order.

Accordingly in about six weeks, a bill was prepared and brought into the House,
and read the first and second time; and--as the manner of the House is,
in such cases of finishing bills--was committed to a certain number of persons--whose
names may not now be nominated,--as a committee to correct and finish the said bill,
and to report concerning the same to the House, in order to its passing into an act.
And accordingly the said committee met together about the 20th day of
the 5th month--if I mistake not,--to read and debate the said bill, etc.
And we being not clear in our hearts towards God and to his people,
to allow this wickedness to be carried on without giving our testimony against it,
as it passed;--that we might be clear from such their proceedings against the innocent,
and that they might be better informed concerning us, and also reproved in their works:
therefore we were moved in our hearts,
in the wisdom of God to endeavour to gain admittance to come before them;
showing the equity of it unto them, that we might better inform them,
and show them our reasons against the said bill.

And having made some provisions thereunto,
by reasoning beforehand with many of the members,--according to our desire,
three of us were permitted to come in,
and were conducted by one of the members of the said committee,
and before them we appeared in the name and authority of the Lord
God:--and after some obstructions as about our hats,
which at last were taken off by one of them, some interrogations were made by them,
as what we were, and where we lived, and why, and on what accounts we there appeared,
etc., which we gave answers unto.
We then had liberty from them to present a manuscript to them,
which was received and read;
and also we had the liberty to speak something concerning the said bill,
and of the unreasonableness of it, and of the woeful consequences which would follow,
if it passed; in brief,
we gave our testimony by the Spirit of the Lord against their proceedings,
and so we were dismissed their presence, and withdrew;
and they proceeded in the business, an exact account of which cannot yet be given.

The next day--as I take it,--the report by the chairman
of the said Committee was made to the House;
thereupon it was thought fit by them that the said
bill should be recommitted for some amendments,
etc.;
and accordingly the committee met again about the
13th of the month aforesaid,--as I remember;
before whom we again obtained the opportunity to appear
by some kindness of some of the members of the Committee;
and that day we gave full testimony against the said
bill,--that it was unrighteous and unreasonable,
etc.--showing our reasons for the same.
And we had much reasoning with them, yet not by way of any capitulation,
but by full denial of the whole matter in that case:
they were more moderate towards us than the first time of their sitting;
and the presence of the Lord was much with us,
and some spirits were subjected under the power of the Truth,
which at that time was declared in much authority and wisdom,
though some of them had much ado to bear what was then said.
The last thing that was said by one of us was,^
footnote:[It seems this was Edward Burrough himself by George Whitehead`'s account.]
that if ever this bill now under debate was finished into an act to be executed,
he was so far from yielding conformity thereunto,
that he should--through the strength of Christ--meet
among the people of God to worship Him;
and not only so, but should make it his business to exhort all God`'s people everywhere,
to meet together for the worship of God, notwithstanding that law and all its penalties,
etc.; and he desired this saying might be reported to the House.

So we, having cleared our consciences to them,
and left a good witness for Truth upon their spirits, left them and withdrew;
and they proceeded in their work that day, and amended the bill,
or rather made it far worse, and more unreasonable than ever,
and that against some of their own consciences and reasonable conviction,--as I do believe;
for they formed it that day into this mode--"`That for the third
offence of refusing to take oaths being lawfully tendered,
and meeting together upon pretence of religion,
above the number of five persons out of our own habitations,
we were referred to be proceeded against by the statute of 35 Eliz+++.+++, which is,
to abjure the realm, or in case of denial to be proceeded against as felons,
without benefit of clergy, etc.`"

About two days after,
the bill with its said new amendments was presented to the House again;
upon which a very great debate arose among them,
so that the bill was altered again into a new and more moderate temper,
being concluded by many of them to be too severe against us as it was brought in.
So the matter was sorely debated in the House,
and the bill was framed and passed as follows:
"`for the first offence of refusing to take an oath lawfully tendered,
and for meeting together as aforesaid, being legally convicted by twelve men,
or the confession of the party, etc., a certain sum should be imposed on us,
by them before whom such conviction was made, not exceeding five pounds;
and this to be taken by distress,
or the person to be committed to the House of Correction or common jail for three months;
for the second offence being convicted as aforesaid,
the sum imposed should not exceed ten pounds, to be taken in like manner by distress,
or the person imprisoned for six months;
and for the third offence being convicted as aforesaid,
it should be lawful for the King to transplant any such
person or persons to any of his plantations beyond the seas:
and this act to be commenced from the first of the seventh month next:`"
this was the form of the bill as it last passed in the House,
being altered three or four times before.
So it was ordered to be engrossed,
and to be brought into the House by such a time for final determination,
and to be sent to the upper House.

But it came into our hearts with much zeal for God and his truth,
and against this unrighteous thing,
and the Lord stirred up the hearts of some of us by his eternal power,
again to give our witness against it,
that we might be clear in our consciences concerning this matter.
So for the very cause of God and his truth, we were given up to do and suffer all things;
and we did boldly attempt to appear at the bar of their House,
that we might give our reasons and clear our hearts against the said bill,
and why it ought not to pass into an act.
To obtain this our appearance before them,
we used several arguments to many of the members of the House, to procure our admittance;
and according to our desire, through the very providence and wisdom of God,
when the bill was read in the House the last time to be finished, we had admittance,
by the vote of the House:
and after some little debate at the door by some of the members about our hats,
the Sergeant came and told us, we might come in with our hats on or off, which we would;
so into the House we were conducted by him with our hats on,
and within the House near the bar he took them off.

Thus at the bar we appeared, in God`'s fear and authority;
and after some queries put to us by the Speaker, to which we answered,
and confessed to that favour of admittance to that place, etc.,
we presented a manuscript to them, which we desired might be received and read by them;
and they did receive it by the hands of their Sergeant;
and also liberty was given us by the Speaker to say what we had upon us.
Accordingly the Lord opened our mouths,
and we showed several sound reasons unto the House against the aforesaid bill,
and why it ought not to pass into an act; 1st,
because of the falsity and unsoundness of it in its ground; 2ndly,
because of the unreasonableness and unjustness of it in itself; and 3rdly,
because of the evil effects of it, which must needs follow if it passed.
And several other things were spoken in the name and authority of the God of heaven,
as concerning our peaceableness, etc. and of the absolute proper right that belong to us,
both from God and men,
to enjoy the liberty of our consciences in the exercise of our religion, etc.
And we had a good time to clear our consciences to them as about that bill,
showing how it was contrary to the law of Christ, and to the King`'s promises,
and destructive to many thousand good people, etc.

They were in much moderation and patience to hear us;
and the word of the Lord through us had an effect upon many,
to qualify their spirits into sobriety through good information.
So having cleared ourselves and left it upon them,
we were ordered by the House to withdraw, which we did:
and they fell into a very great debate upon the matter; some spoke for us,
and many against us, and some were neuters; and the debate continued about an hour,
before the vote of the House determined the thing.
But at last through difficulty among themselves it was finished,
and the bill sent to the upper House there to be read,
and passed fit for the King to sign.^
footnote:[Extract from [.book-title]#Journals of the House of Commons,#
under the date of 19th of 6th month 1661:--"`A bill for preventing
the mischiefs and dangers that may arise by certain persons called
Quakers and others refusing to take lawful oaths,
being engrossed, was this day read a third time.
A petition being tendered on behalf of certain persons called
Quakers by some at the door who go under that notion,
who desired to be heard before the said bill do pass--__Resolved,__
That the persons at the door be called in.
And the said four persons, namely Edward Burrough, Richard Hubberthorne,
George Whitehead,
and Edward Pyot being thereupon permitted to come to the bar of this House,
did severally offer what they had to say against the passing of the said bill;
and tendered a printed paper which they desired might be read.
After which, they being caused to withdraw,
and the House resuming the debate of the said bill; _Resolved,_
That the said bill does pass: and that the title of the said bill be, [.book-title]#An Act for Preventing the Mischiefs and Dangers That May Arise by Certain
Persons Called Quakers and Others Refusing to Take Lawful Oaths.`"#]

Well, but still the Spirit of the Lord, and a zeal for his truth was upon us,
to pursue it with faithful evidence against it, wherever it came;
and we gave in some manuscripts among the members of the upper House,
and various reasons in writing, etc. and we had hopes to have been heard by them,
if they had proceeded.
And the Lord made our endeavours effectual in clearing of our consciences,
and informing them concerning the innocency of our cause,
and the unjust destructiveness of the said bill.
But the God of our peace and happiness by his power put a stop to it in that House,
so that the Lords--so called--only read it once in their House, and so laid it by,
and proceeded not any further in it then; this was through the goodness of the Lord,
to cross and stop the will of many of our adversaries, that seek our destruction:
the glory of this present deliverance belongs to the God of heaven,
and to him it is given.

The Parliament is now adjourned till the 20th of the 9th month,
and nothing effected by them against us,
though the aforesaid bill is still in being against us:
and whether they may have power to bring it forth at their next Sessions,
I leave that to the Lord; who does and allows to be done whatever he wills.
Let us therefore have respect to him only, and walk humbly before him;
and be in perfect patience to do or suffer anything for his name sake,
and the blessed Truth which he has given us to profess and practice.
Thus I have in brief given the substance of a relation as to the manner--though
not fully as to the matter--of proceedings in the case aforesaid,
a particular account as of the various manuscripts given to them,
and verbal speeches and discourses with them, and of the orders of the House,
and other things relating to this business.

Let all Friends walk in meekness and humility, and in faithfulness towards God,
and in wisdom and patience and good will towards all men;
that so you may all be preserved in a clear conscience,
and may deserve a repute for inoffensiveness in all matters among your neighbours:
that so no just occasion may be taken against us by our adversaries:
but that in their consciences they may be forced to confess to our harmless conversations.
And if at any time they will act against us, and cause us to suffer,
it may be on their part against knowledge, and on our part for the cause of God only,
and for his Truth`'s sake, and not for evil doing.
Keep your meetings in all wisdom and in the fear of the Lord,
to the edifying of your souls.
And God Almighty preserve you all.

Your friend known to you in the invisible life of righteousness.

7th month 1661.

+++[+++Along with the foregoing [.book-title]#Brief Account,#
was found--in the same handwriting--a copy
of Edward Burrough`'s [.book-title]#Reasons and Considerations Against the Said Bill,
Presented to the Lords Assembled in Parliament:#--the
reasons are drawn up in very forcible language,
and are somewhat similar to those presented to the House of Commons;
they conclude with the following noble and memorable declaration.]

[.small-break]
'''

This is the perfect state of our case, and an absolute extremity is put upon us,
either to disobey the law of God and to deny Christ before men,
and so to destroy our souls, and be ourselves under the wrath of God,
or to disobey your intended law, and so to expose our persons, estates, lives,
and families to utter destruction in this world.
For the law of God and this law, in the cases mentioned,
are plainly opposite one to another; for Christ says, "`Swear not at all,`" Matt. 5;
and the Apostle James says, "`Above all things, my brethren, swear not;
neither by heaven, nor by earth, nor by any other oath; but let your yes be yes,
and your no no, lest you fall into condemnation.`"

But this law enjoins to swear; and everyone that refuses to swear,
shall undergo such forfeitures, penalties, and banishments.
Whether it is better to obey God`'s law or this,
and to undergo God`'s displeasure or yours for disobedience, you judge.
Also, God has commanded us to meet together to worship him in spirit and in truth;
and the apostle has exhorted,
(Heb. 10) not to forsake the assembling of ourselves together,
but to exhort one another; and not to sin in neglect of our duty,
upon the penalty of a certain fearful looking for
of judgment and fiery indignation from God;
and it was the practice of the primitive Christians to meet together,
and sit sometime in private houses: but this law prohibits our meeting together,
upon such forfeitures and penalties, even unto banishment.

Whether of these two laws are the more just and to be obeyed,
let the God of heaven and your own consciences bear witness: if we disobey the one,
we gain the wrath of God to the destruction of our souls; and if we disobey the other,
we gain the wrath of men to the utter destruction of our families, estates,
and lives in this world.
This is our present case, and our sad extremity!
But we are resolved in the name of the Lord to obey God and his righteous laws and commands,
though we suffer absolute destruction in this world;
and we will trust the God of heaven with our cause,
which is the cause of a good conscience, which is the Lord`'s and not our own,
of Him and not of ourselves; and we will walk in the ways of His Truth and commandments,
and will meet together to worship the Father in spirit and in truth,
and exhort one another thereunto for our comfort and edification in the Holy Spirit,
notwithstanding any law of man to the contrary: and if, for so doing,
we perish,--we perish! and our blood will be upon our persecutors;
and the reward of our destruction will come upon you,
if you go on passing laws against the law of God,
for the persecution and ruin of us his people.
We heartily desire you to take this into your consideration,
and that the fear and wisdom of God may be among you.^

"`May 31st. The Earl of Pembroke reported from the Committee that
were appointed to consider of the Quaker`'s petition,
That the Committee after long debate, were of opinion,
that the second proposition in the paper put in by the Quakers
concerning "`yes`" and "`no,`" to be taken in lieu of oaths,
should be rejected: That the Committee having rejected it,
thought fit to offer it as their opinion,
that a promissory oath should be tendered to the Quakers,
such a one as no good subject can or ought to refuse:
That the third proposition concerning respects and putting off of hats, etc.,
be rejected: That the fourth clause, concerning their not coming to the public worship,
and the first being dependent upon it (as to their private meetings,)
being too weighty for the determination of the committee,
they thought fit to be reported to this House, to be debated by the House.

"`The Committee also is of opinion,
that the fifth clause concerning not paying of tithes, etc., be rejected:
That the sixth clause concerning their not observing days, meats, etc.,
having a dependence on the fourth concerning public worship,
is fit also to be debated by the whole House.
That the Committee will consider of the second part of the order
of the House for a remedy of the distempers of these people,
when they have received the resolution of the House concerning
the third clause offered to their resolution by the Committee.
July 23rd. The bill is read a first time; but an adjournment of the House takes place.
November 26th, it is read a second time, and is committed; on the Committee,
are six bishops (York, London, etc.)
The bill is reported under date of "`November 29th,`" with alterations;
is again committed;
is reported once more with amendments "`December 17th,`" and again re-committed.--1662,
January 16th, the Earl of Bridgewater reports upon the bill;
it is again re-committed and ordered to be made to extend to Quakers only;
"`the Committee are to meet tomorrow morning at eight of the clock.`"--January 28th,
the bill is again reported, and alterations agreed to; is read a third time and passed;
and is sent down to the Commons to desire their concurrence in
the alterations.--
{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`February 18th, a message from the Commons was brought up to desire a conference upon the Bill
touching the Quakers next morning (at eleven of the clock) in the Painted chamber.`"
The Lord Chancellor reports the result, that the Commons disagree in some points, namely,
"`they adhere to the word '`others`' in the title of the bill,
to meet with all others who refuse oaths besides Quakers; such are some Anabaptists:
to leave out the word '`others`' would frustrate the end of the bill:
and besides it is not easy to define what a Quaker is, if so restrained;
and it is not possible to enumerate all the names by which
several sects would call themselves to evade the bill;
and it were great partiality to single out the Quakers,
and pretermit others as dangerous,
if not more.`"--"`They likewise disagree with the amendment '`any ten
or more persons;`' because the mischief may be great when five meet,
but the remedy is not so easy when ten meet,`" etc., The House of Lords
again refers the whole matter to the same Committee before appointed;
they order the word "`others`" to be added in;
also to extend the Bill to all others who maintain that all oaths are unlawful.

[.salutation]
Dearly Beloved Friends,

In the life and power and spirit of our heavenly Father, do our souls salute you all;
heartily praying for you,
that peace and blessings and assurance forever may be continued and increased to you.
Dwell and walk in the grace of God, which will keep you pure and perfect:
and keep your meetings in the name and spirit of Christ, and the Lord will be among you.

As for things here with us in relation to the Truth, they are very well;
and the Truth of God is in esteem among the upright and
grows daily into dominion over the evil spirits of the world;
and Friends are bold and faithful to the Lord, to be, or do,
or suffer anything for the name of Christ: and they are, in the Father`'s will,
patiently waiting upon Him to receive more and more of his life and wisdom and fulness.

As for the proceedings in Parliament, it is thus: since their last assembling,
they have had us in several debates among them in both Houses;
and it was supposed by many, and desired by all our enemies,
that the bill prepared against us by the Commons,
and sent to the upper House at their last sessions--of which you have had a former
account--would have been finished against us by the higher House this sitting.
It was several times under consideration,
both in the House and by the committee appointed for that end,
of which committee were six bishops;
and there lacked not zeal in many to effect the carrying of it on and finishing it: but,
however, the last third-day of the week, they fell upon it as the last time;
and by course of proceeding, it should then have been determined against us,
but it was carried among them in the negative;
so it is put off for the present till their next meeting:
what will then be done we must leave to the Lord.

Last sixth-day, they adjourned till the seventh of next month.
This is the sum of the present proceedings in relation to us.
There is a certain hand of the Lord in ordering these matters,
and yet has hitherto prevented the purpose of our adversaries,
and brought to naught the counsel of such as desired
our destruction long before this day.
But let Friends walk in the fear and in the wisdom and counsel of the Most High;
and let all the world have nothing against you of evil in the things of this world,
nor anything, saving the matters of God, and for his worship sake:
and if we are persecuted, and suffer as such only, and for this cause,
the Lord will be our peace and everlasting reward.

Here in London, meetings are very quiet as ever they were, and large;
and Friends are well in the general.
We hear the act against meetings is passed both Houses,
but the King has not yet signed it.
There were some of the Lords and the Bishop of Exeter that did speak against it;
yet notwithstanding, the Chancellor^
footnote:[Hyde, Earl of Clarendon.]
and the greatest part carried it.

There was a Friend told me this day, he had been with Marsh,--one of the bedchamber,^

for particulars respecting this person,
who appears to have kindly interested himself on behalf of George Fox.]--to
deliver to him a paper of Friends`' sufferings in the plantations abroad,
for him to deliver them to the King; and he told the Friend that he heard the King say,
there should be liberty of conscience granted to our Friends in the plantations abroad,
and that he intended it: and he did not question but to get an order to that effect.

[.salutation]
Dear Margaret Fell,

The remembrance of your love is very refreshing to me: and for passages here,
the news is sad indeed; yet I think to acquaint you how it is with us.
The last first-day, as innocently as ever, Friends kept their usual meetings;
and about the tenth hour came the life-guard with their headpieces and breast-pieces,
and in Cheapside they remained; and the trained band-men then came to the Bull,
+++[+++Bull and Mouth meetinghouse,]
and laid hold of all the Friends they could, which were very many;
some were carried on their muskets to prison, and some very much beaten and abused,
as bad as formerly;--the same man commanding the soldiers,
as did that day the Friend was wounded who died.

What passed at other meetings as to the abusing and beating I cannot here relate;
but at several meetings that day there were taken and imprisoned
about eight score,--ninety-six being put in the common jail,
all men except three women: and that day they took abundance of Baptists;
seven score I hear are to be brought from Westminster to Newgate,
where they were upon examination.
What the reason is of this sudden calamity that is come upon us so undeservedly,
I am not certain;
but there are several reports concerning the cause of their so afflicting us:
the main thing that is alleged is, that there was a plot found out;
and I hear that the Baptists did meet that morning
by the third hour at one of their meeting-places;
Major-General Brown^
footnote:[Formerly in Cromwell`'s army,
but afterwards Alderman and Lord Mayor of London.--See [.book-title]#Sewel`'s History,#
(1662) for an account of his cruelties upon Friends in London.]
heard of it, and was at Whitehall by four in the morning;
but whether they met to any ill, and to plot or such like, I know not.

The King and Council would have Friends promise,
that they will not take up arms against the King;
but other answer we have not yet returned.
But you know our principle is to live in peace and quietness, and that is our delight;
and that which leads us to suffer,
rather than to lose the peace with God in our consciences,
does also lead us to live in peace with all men,
seeking their good and eternal happiness.^
footnote:[It is somewhat remarkable,
that soon after the passing of the Act against Friends,
another Royal Proclamation "`of grace`" was issued in their favour;
it is indeed stated to be put forth on the occasion
of the coming into the country of a Queen consort:
the following extract from [.book-title]#Kennet`'s Chronicle# describes
the Proclamation:--
{footnote-paragraph-split}
_"`August 22nd,

{footnote-paragraph-split}
__The King`'s Letter of Grace and Indulgence
to the Quakers and other Separatists directed to the Lord Mayor of London, etc.

{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`We are informed that there are several
persons who go under the name of Quakers and other names of separation,
now in the jails of London and Middlesex, for being at unlawful assemblies;
who yet profess all obedience and allegiance unto us.
We would be glad that all our subjects could be brought
to agree in a uniform worship of God;
and we hope that the foresight of the dangers which
they run into by a willful contempt of the laws,
and our present indulgence, may prevail with some of these persons,
to reduce them to a better conformity.
And therefore we do willingly lay hold of this time and occasion
of public joy for the first coming in of our dear consort the Queen,
to our Royal Palace at Westminster, to declare this our Royal pleasure unto you,
that you cause all such of the said persons int our jails for London and Middlesex,
who have not been indicted for refusing the oath of allegiance,
nor shall appear to you to have been ringleaders or preachers at their assemblies,
to be enlarged.

+++[+++In this year 1662,
the work of persecution against Friends was carried
on with increased earnestness and cruelty,
under the act against their meetings, etc.
George Whitehead says,
"`Our meetings in and about London were broken up by force and violence,
by the trained bands and officers, especially on the first-days of the week:
such work they commonly wrought on that day,
which they pretend to be their christian sabbath and the Lord`'s day,
and to be kept holy,`" etc.
It was not long before George Whitehead himself,
with his friends Richard Hubberthorne and Edward Burrough,
became victims to this severe persecution; being haled out of meeting,
and committed to Newgate.
In this prison the Friends were so unmercifully thronged together,
that a violent fever broke out among them, whereof some died.
Before the time of their imprisonment was expired, George Whitehead informs us,
his dear brethren and fellow-labourers in the gospel,
Richard Hubberthorne and Edward Burrough fell sick,
and the Lord was pleased to release them from their sufferings by death.^

From Newgate, 1662.

Friends here are generally well in the inward and outward man;
and the presence of the Lord is manifest with us,
through great trials and sore afflictions, and grievous persecutions,
which we have met with this last half-year.
It would be too large to relate, and piercing of your hearts to hear,
the violence and cruelty which Friends have suffered
in this city in their meetings and in prisons;
it has been my hard lot to bear the persecution inflicted every way;
though the Lord has given strength and boldness, and his power alone has carried through,
else many would have fainted and not been able to stand.
Many have given up their lives in faithfulness, in this place;
and their faithfulness in keeping meetings,
and in patiently enduring many tribulations and cruel exercises,
is a crown upon Friends in this city.
Here are now near 250 of us prisoners in Newgate, Bridewell, Southwark,
and the New Prison.

In Newgate, we are extremely thronged,
that if the mercy of the Lord had not preserved us, we could not have endured;
there is near a hundred in one room on the common side among the felons,
and their sufferings are great; but the Lord supports.
For about six weeks time the meetings were generally quiet in the city;
but these last three weeks they were fallen on more violently than ever,
and many Friends were imprisoned: but through all this, Truth is of good report,
and the nobility of it gains place in many hearts,
which are opened in pity and compassion towards the innocent sufferers;
and Truth is increased through all trials.
Our trust is in the Lord and not in man;
and we desire the same spirit may dwell and abide in you also,
that you may be like-minded with us, and be all of the mind of Christ;
who seeks men`'s salvation, and not their destruction.

Dear George, since my coming here we have had much good service for the Lord;
meetings are very large, and of late time very peaceable,
except that at the Spittlefields; Friends have been kept forth there,
and have met in the streets for three first-days;^
footnote:["`When kept out of their meetinghouses by the soldiers,`" Sewel writes,
"`they used not to go away, but stood before the place, and so their number increased;
and then one or other of their ministers generally
stepped upon a bench or some high place,
and so preached boldly:
thus he got sometimes more hearers than otherwise he might have had.
When one minister was pulled down, then another stood up and preached;
and thus often four or five were taken away one after another, and carried to prison.
This keeping of meetings in the street,
now became a customary thing.`"
{footnote-paragraph-split}
Friends
"`were persuaded that the exercise of their public worship,
was a duty no man could discharge them from,
and they believed that God required the performing of this service from their hands.
Thus they got abundance of auditors, and among these, sometimes eminent men,
who passing by in their coaches, made their coachmen stop.
At this rate they found there was a great harvest,
and thus their church increased under sufferings.`"--[.book-title]#Sewel,# vol.
ii. pp.
4, 5.]
and the last first-day Joseph Higgins being there and standing up to speak a few words,
was taken away by the constables and soldiers, and brought before one of the Aldermen;
who after examination, did commit him to the Poultry Counter, where he yet remains;
I was with him today; he was in health.
I was likewise down at Westminster,
but cannot hear that the bill for conformity has passed the higher House as yet.^
footnote:[The bill to prevent and suppress seditious conventicles.]
Friends have had their meetings within the Bull and Mouth for the three last first-days:
I was there last first-day, and we had a good, favoured, weighty meeting,
and much larger than ever formerly,
insomuch that many were constrained to go back because they had not room.
Morgan Watkins was at Pell Mell last first-day, very quiet: Josiah Coale at Peele;
John Shield at Horsleydown, W. Brid +++[+++?]
and Gerard Roberts, at Myle-end; all very peaceable.

+++[+++Respecting the writer of the following letter, Josiah Coale,
our historian Sewel has left this testimony:--"`It
was his life and joy to declare the gospel,
and to proclaim the word of God; for which he had an excellent ability:
and when he spoke to the ungodly world, an awful gravity appeared in his countenance,
and his words were like a hammer and a sharp sword.
But though he was a son of thunder,
yet his agreeable speech flowed from his mouth like a pleasant stream,
to the consolation and comfort of pious souls.
Oh! how pathetically have I heard him pray; when he, as transported and ravished,
humbly beseeched God, that it might please him to reach to the hard-hearted,
to support the godly, and to preserve them stedfast: indeed,
with what a charming and melodious voice did he sound forth
the praises of the most High in his public prayers!
He had travelled much in the West Indies, sustained great hardships,
and laboured in the ministry at his own charge,
being freely given up to spend his substance in the service of the Lord.
Though he went through many persecutions, imprisonments, and other adversities,
yet he was not afraid of danger, but was always valiant;
and he continued in an unmarried state,
that so he might the more freely labour in the heavenly harvest;
and many were converted by his ministry.`"
He died in 1668.^

Dear George,

With fervent, hearty, sincere, and true love, which is of God,
and with which my heart is at this time filled,
do I in the fear of the Lord dearly salute you, as beloved of my soul;
and do give you to understand, that in uprightness of heart to the Lord,
my life is still given up to his service;
and his precious presence and almighty power is still continued with me,
by which I bless God I am still for his service as ever:
and my heart is filled with fervency of zeal for his name and glory,
more and more from day to day.
The full content and desire of my soul is with me,--he enlarges my heart by his power;
so that indeed nothing is too dear to me to part with, or to suffer the loss of,
for his sake.

Dear George, it is now near six weeks since I left the city of London;
and I have been visiting Friends about the country in Surrey, Oxfordshire,
and Bedfordshire; I expect to visit Friends also in Hertfordshire,
before I return to the city, for indeed I am not clear of it;
but dear A. P. and Morgan Watkins being there, takes it at present off me.
I believe you have heard of the bustlings and prisonings that have been of late;
but last first-day I hear all was quiet and well.
John Audland and John Story are about Bristol; Joseph Coale gone westward.

I have little more to signify to you at present, only having this opportunity,
it was in my heart to signify my unfeigned love to you, which I believe you well know;
who am yours in the Lord.

Dear Margaret Fell,

My dear and true love is to you and to George Fox.
Hearing of your imprisonment +++[+++in Lancaster Castle]
I write to you, and I would have George Fox see the enclosed.
Concerning the sufferings of Friends I have drawn them up in three copies,
one for the King, and the other two for the Speakers, and then I intend to print it.

There were forty Friends taken last first-day at Reading,
which will make up about 650 in prison.
There were last week three Friends carried out dead together in
one day out of Northampton jail,--John Samm was one of them;
Daniel Wills and several others are very sick in the prison, and not likely to live;
there being twenty-seven in that jail.^
footnote:["`John Samm was a faithful minister of the Gospel,
an incessant labourer in the work of the ministry,
and of an exemplary life and conduct.`"
A violent fever had broken out in this prison, and "`seized first some of the felons;
to whom as fellow creatures and fellow prisoners,
(though in a cause vastly different,) the Friends thought
it their duty to be assistant in their extreme weakness,
and accordingly did what they could for them;
till at length the air being exceedingly corrupted with the breath of the distempered,
a kind of contagion spread among the prisoners, and the Friends so generally fell sick,
that when called over at the court session,
only four (of twenty-two) were able to appear before the Judge,`" who,
hearing of their condition, gave a private order for them to be let out for air.
The next year, 1664, some of them died:
"`these all finished their course in peace and full assurance of faith;
being enabled in the midst of their afflictions to sing praises unto the Lord,
and bless his name, to the edification and comfort one of another,
and to the astonishment of others who beheld their piety and patience.`"--[.book-title]#Besse`'s Sufferings,#

Dear George,

The service is very great and weighty here, and we are but few to perform it.
Our meetings of late have been very large, and peaceable for the most part,
I have not known the like since I saw London; there is little disturbance at all,
only sometimes they keep Friends out of the Bull on the first-days, and at Spittlefields;
but the last first-day Friends were within doors,
and all the meetings in and about the city were very quiet.
At Reading most of men Friends are in prison;
and I heard today that they hale and pull the women
Friends out of the meetinghouse to prison:^

(as I hear;) they have not yet perfected anything against nonconformists:
but it is reported there is a bill in the House that is like to be very severe:
how far they may proceed, a little time will manifest.
I hope the Lord will arm his people with boldness and strength suitable to the trial.

Dear George, let your prayers be still for us,
that we may persevere unto the end in our testimony for God,
that in the end we may be crowned with life.
None at present are here in the public service but Josiah Coale

[.salutation]
Dear George Fox,

Having this opportunity to send to you,
I thought it fitting to acquaint you somewhat of affairs here,
since my last letter to you.
As to meetings in the city, they are well and generally quiet,
only on first-days Friends are kept out of the Bull and Mouth.
The last first-day I was there in the street, and had a very good service,
and a great resort there was;
and in the afternoon had a very good meeting in Horsleydown.
The bill against the Sectaries I do not understand that it is passed in the Upper House,
but in the Lower it is; and is expected to be in both.^
footnote:[A curious circumstance occurred in Parliament
respecting this bill against conventicles:
a clause concerning Friends, intended to stand as part of the bill,
and which had passed as such in the House of Peers, was lost,
before it reached the Commons.
A conference was accordingly had between the two Houses on the third reading,
upon which the Earl of Anglesey reported to the House of Peers:
+++[+++Lords`' [.book-title]#Journals# under date "`May 16, 1664.`"+++]+++
"`That the House of Commons acquainted their lordships at this conference,
that since the last free conference, they,
looking into the said bill against seditious conventicles,
find the proviso concerning the Quakers missing,
which they conceive to be a material part of the bill: therefore,
they desire this House to supply the defect.`"
It was avowed by some Peers that the bill, with the said proviso,
was delivered to Sergeant Charleton.
A committee of Peers then searched for the original draft of the proviso,
which was found, and agreed to be the same:
the lost clause was then returned to the Commons,
and the bill was only just in time to receive the royal assent.
{footnote-paragraph-split}
This act against conventicles came into
force the 1st of the month called July of this year,
and it was to continue for three years.
"`It may not be improper (writes George Whitehead)
to give some account of this second Act of Parliament,
designed not only for our imprisonment,
but also for our banishment out of the land of our nativity;
and that with more expedition than could be effected by the first act against Quakers;
though the Lord our God would not allow that design of banishment,
to take any such general effect against us, as was desired by our invidious persecutors;
for by his judgments He in a great measure frustrated our adversaries.
Howbeit many of our innocent Friends were sentenced to banishment;
yet but few (in comparison) were actually shipped away, or banished out of the land.`"
This act provided that if any person above sixteen years
of age were convicted of being present at any meeting,
conventicle, etc., under colour or pretence of any exercise of religion,
in other manner than is allowed by the liturgy of the Church of England,
he should be fined £5 or be imprisoned three months:
for the second offence £10 or six months imprisonment;
and for the third offence to be transported for seven years:
the offender`'s goods to be distrained upon for expenses of transportation.
"`Under the power of this act, our religious assemblies were often disturbed and broken,
by the persecuting agents, officers, and soldiers,
and many of us apprehended and brought before magistrates;--and
no matter of evil fact proved against any of us,
but for worshipping the Lord Almighty according to their consciences.
Great were the sufferings of Friends in consequence
of this cruel act;--many were made widows and fatherless,
and honest industrious Friends and their families grievously distressed, fined,
and spoiled of their property.`"]

Margaret Fell`'s address +++[+++(?) _partly torn_]
about your sufferings there, was last week delivered to the King,
by Elizabeth Bell and another Friend,
who were ordered by the King to go up yesterday for an answer, to the Secretary;
which accordingly they did:
his answer was to this effect,--that nothing could be done in it by the King,
but he had left it to the Council and the Parliament.^
footnote:[Doubtless of George Fox and Friends, in Lancaster Castle.
See [.book-title]#George Fox`'s Journal,# 1664]

Since I came to this city,
I have been somewhat troubled that the books of sufferings were not delivered
sooner;--how Ellis Hookes ordered the business I know not.
Yesterday I went up and down a great part of the day about getting them
delivered;--this day I expect a pretty good quantity of them will be given,
and Gilbert Latey is this morning to make way for the women that are to deliver them.^

Endeared and Tender-hearted Mother,

My duty and very dear love is freely given and remembered unto you,

This is chiefly to let you understand, that yesterday sis +++[+++sister]
and I were at Whitehall, where we spoke to the King,
and told him that if he would please to signify something to the Judges,
before they went their circuit, to release you; otherwise it would be past,
for the time drew very near of the court session.
He said he would release you, if we would promise you would not go to meetings.
Sister said, we could make no such engagement; for the meeting has been kept many years,
and never has done any harm.
He said, "`Cannot your mother keep within her own family,
as she may have five persons present;--but she must have such tumultuous meetings.`"
We said, she has no such meetings; they are only her neighbours that come.

I was there about a week since,
and told the King that now the court session drew very near,
if he did not do something for you, they would run you into a premunire,
and get your estate from you and your children;
and I desired him to take it into consideration.
He was then very loving to me, and said he would take it into consideration; and he said,
"`they shall not have her estate from her:`" he took
me by the hand as soon as he came near me.
I also spoke to Prince Rupert, and desired him to put the King in mind of it;
and he said, he would do what he could in it; and went then to the King and spoke to him.
Prince +++[+++Rupert]
has always been very loving to Friends, and has often spoke to the King about you.

Sister gives the renewed remembrance of her entire love to you and dear George Fox,
as also does my brother.
I suppose sisters Isabel and Sarah will be gone:--remember me to sisters;
Susanna and Rachel.

Dear George Fox and Margaret,

My dear and upright love is to you both, and to the rest of Friends with you.
Since the writing of the enclosed, I thought fit to send it to you,
having not freedom at present to write much into the North by post.
Alexander Parker and Richard Farnsworth are in the city, and yet at liberty.
George: I got your paper to Friends printed, as you desired, and disposed of several more.
Samuel Fisher and Joseph Fuce are prisoners still,
but have liberty from the keeper for a little time: but we are to be kept without bail, etc.
I have met with some hard usage since I came here; the first night we came,
we were put into the common felon`'s ward,
because we could not agree to uphold the jailer`'s oppression:
and then the felons took our money from us out of our pockets,
for their drunken custom called "`garnish:`" and the place was so noisome,
that we had not whereon to lay our head to rest:
but I doubt not but the Lord will work through all these things for us.
It is well I am in this prison, and I am satisfied in it.^

George Whitehead was accused of having been concerned in a plot in the north,

guarded with musketeers and the jailer with them, where he was examined:
but one "`stepped in on the occasion, who seemed to be an ancient gentleman,
and hearing my accusers tell me my name was not Whitehead, contradicted him, saying,
he has written several books, to which his name is in print: this gave a check to him,
and prevented further examination.`"
George Whitehead afterwards wrote to the Secretary
of State to clear himself of those false insinuations,

footnote:[The above letter speaks of Samuel Fisher and Joseph Fuce,
respecting whom Besse gives the following account:--"`About the end of this summer, 1663,
Samuel Fisher, Joseph Fuce, George Brigstock, and Thomas Moore,
were taken together in a meeting at Charlewood,
and committed to the White Lion Prison in Southwark, where they lay till two of them,
namely, Samuel Fisher and Joseph Fuce, died.
Samuel Fisher was a man of great parts and literature,
formerly a parish preacher at Lydd in Kent,
but voluntarily relinquished his benefice of about £400 per annum,
and joined in society with the people called Baptists for some time.
In the year 1655,
he became convinced of the Truth as professed by the people called Quakers;
and through obedience thereto, he became a faithful minister of the same,
and travelled much in the work and service of the Lord, not only in England,
but in other countries.
At Dunkirk in Flanders he had good service,
in testifying against the idolatry of the priests and friars,
and in declaring Truth to the English garrison there.
He afterwards travelled on foot over the Alps to Rome,
and bore a faithful testimony against the Papists in that city.
After his return to England, in the four last years of his life,
his sufferings were very great;
for in 1661 he was several months a prisoner in the Gate-house in Westminster.
Soon after his release from there, he was apprehended passing the streets,
and sent to Wood-street Compter, and after some time had to Guildhall, where,
refusing to take the oaths, he was committed to Newgate,
and lay there about twelve months; and in a short time after his discharge,
he was taken again at Charlewood, and sent to prison in Southwark, as before related;
where after two years continuance,
he rested from his labours in perfect peace with the Lord,
and was well beloved both by the brotherhood and others;
for as he excelled in natural parts and acquired abilities,
so was he exemplary for his christian humility and condescension,
in meekness instructing those that opposed him, and incessantly labouring,
either by word or writing,
to spread and promote the doctrine of Truth among the children of men.
He died on the last day of the month called August,
1665.
{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`Joseph Fuce travelled
in many countries in the work of the ministry,
and had an excellent gift for the convincing of gainsayers,
being frequently exercised in disputes with Independent, Baptists, and other preachers.
He was a man of a patient, meek spirit, and very laborious in the work of the ministry,
whereunto God had called him.`"--[.book-title]#Besse`'s Sufferings,# vol.

[.salutation]
Dear George,

My love in the Lord does dearly reach forth and extend itself to you;
and therewith do I most dearly salute you,
even in the bond of love and covenant of peace and life;
into which the Lord by his eternal power and arm of strength has gathered many
in this day of his appearance and lovingkindness unto the sons of men;
in which we are daily made partakers of his endless riches and mercies,
which he multiplies unto us, and renews in us through Christ our Lord and life;
by and through which we live, and are kept alive unto Him,
and enabled to do his will and to answer his requirings,
in whatsoever he makes known and reveals unto us to be our duty to do.

Truly, dear George,
the Lord is not slack concerning the promises of His blessings unto his own seed,
now in its suffering condition; neither is He lacking unto us in this our time of trial:
but indeed I may say in truth, that He causes his love and kindness to abound in us,
and our cups to overflow.
What may I say of his endless love,--it is indeed beyond declaring;
for I know not what more can be desired than the Lord has done for us or given unto us,
as concerning the present enjoyment of his rich love and blessings; for which blessings,
glory and praise be unto his name forever and ever!
Amen.

And now dear George, to give you an account of things here, and how it has been of late,
it is in my heart at this time to do.
Yesterday was a week,
after I had been speaking the Truth to the people
in the Bull and Mouth about one hour and a-half,
the sheriff came, with (I judge) near half a hundred of the city officers,
to break our meeting:
and after they had made a proclamation in the street for
the multitude to depart (for they feared the multitude,
which was great,
that came to see what became of us,) they rushed
in violently to the meeting and commanded me down;
but I was not free at their command.

Then they drew their swords, and one of them laid on me with a hanger,
but struck with the flat side of it; and the rest laid on Friends with swords and staves,
and so pulled me down and out to the sheriff in the yard.
Then I spoke to them of the unmanliness of their proceedings,
to come in such a posture among an innocent peaceable people that
would not resist them,--that it was far below the spirit of a man;
and they were ashamed, and commanded the swords to be put up.
So afterwards they fetched out the rest of the meeting more quietly;
and two or three of the officers took me and led me alone to the Guildhall;
and afterwards brought Friends, two, three, four, and six at a time to me,
till they had brought near two hundred.

And I drew them together about the judgment seat,
and had there a very precious meeting for the power and
presence of the Lord was plentifully manifested among us.
So after a while the Mayor and Aldermen, etc. came,
but were so employed with Baptists and Pendents, +++[+++Independents,]
that they meddled not with us; but kept us there under strong guards till midnight,
not permitting Friends to come to us but they had
one way or another turned out near half our company.
Then about midnight they brought us to Newgate,
(that people might not see;) and the next day they sent for about twenty to the Guildhall,
and committed about sixteen, and let the rest go.

The fourth-day they sent for me and eleven more, saying,
we must go before the Mayor and Bishop at Guildhall;
but when we came there no Bishop appeared: and I asked of the Mayor for the Bishop,
telling him it had been more honourable to have sent
him to the Bull and Mouth with his spiritual weapons,
and thereby to have overcome us if he could: but he would say little to that,
but appeared very moderate to me.
I had fine talk with him, and he told me he had rather set us at liberty than commit us,
but he could not avert it; for I must either pay five shillings fine,
or go to prison for fourteen days.
I told him if he would prove that I was in meeting in other
manner than is allowed by the Liturgy of the Church of England,
I would then pay him 5s.; but he would not say more, but left the bench,
and I was sent away.
Then they called in the rest, one at a time, and committed them in like manner:
they did it in an inner room, where none but themselves might hear,
though many hundreds of people were without, murmuring to get in;
and so they sent us to Newgate again.
On sixth-day they sent the rest, about sixty in all, to the Old Bailey,
and committed them for about nine days a piece.

On third-day last, as I was speaking in our meeting on the chapel side +++[+++in Newgate,]
one of the keeper`'s men came and fetched me away,
and put me in the hole where condemned men used to be put;
but they kept me not there an hour.
On fifth-day as I was speaking, he came again; and because Friends stood around about me,
that he could not reach me, he fell laying on both men and women with a great staff;
and the felons fell on with their fists beating Friends;
and some of the women thieves with a knife or knives, threatened to stab Friends,
and did attempt so to do, but were prevented.
At last they brought me away and put me to dear Anthony Pearson in Justice`'s hall:
and I wrote to the Mayor and sent a Friend with it.
He seemed to be wroth with them for so abusing us, and said we should not be so abused;
but he would take a speedy course to have it otherwise.

Since that, he +++[+++the keeper`'s man]
would let me go over to them sometimes, but not be always with them.
I have very quiet precious meetings with them when I go;
and indeed the glorious and mighty power of God is felt, to the admiration of many.
But last first-day, the Mayor and wicked Brown came to the Bull meeting themselves;
and Friends were fetched out before them in the porch,
where they fined them and committed them, upwards of 200, and sent them to Newgate:
but they that brought them, turned many away by the way;
and some of the halbert men would run away from them, and leave them in the street;
so that I think but about 120 only were brought in.
But Brown showed himself very cruel, and pinched the women sorely,
and pulled the hair of the men`'s heads: and would take them by the hats,
and bring their heads near the ground, and then cast their hats in the dirt.

James Parke was taken there; and from the Peele about thirty were brought to Newgate,
and about twelve from Mile-end; but we know not yet how long they are committed for:
we judge here are in all in this Newgate about 300 of us.
But the Lord is with us of a truth,
and does bear up our hearts far above all sufferings,--blessed be his name forever!
John Higgins and one more are in upon the third account;
and at Hertford eight are sentenced to be banished,
four to Barbados and four to Jamaica; and some more are in on the third account.

Dear George, pray for us, that we may be kept faithful in the power and authority of God,
and that his presence and love may be always continued with us.
Dear Alexander Parker dearly salutes you;
and my love salutes Margaret Fell and the rest with you.
I would be glad to hear from you, who am yours in the Lord.

[.salutation]
Dear George Fox and Margaret Fell,

Whom I unfeignedly love and dearly salute,
these are to let you know that I have received your letter;
and George Whitehead (who has been released) drew
me up the heads of it in a very good manner,
and I carried it to the Lord Obeny +++[+++Albany (?)]
as you directed me; who had been sick of late, and not very well when I came to him.
I told him my business, and from whom it came; so when he had heard me what I had to say,
this to me was his answer,--that all was shut up, and nothing could be done;
and that neither the King nor Chancellor would do anything at all for us.
Neither could any man be heard to speak for us.

Then I told him of the unjustness of your imprisonment, and of the badness of the jury,
and its being contrary to law; and that you desired nothing but a +++[+++fair (?)]
prison, and that the thieves and murderers had more liberty than you,
and that you were locked up in a bad room,
and Friends not permitted to come to speak to you; and I told him I had a paper of it,
and desired him that he would hand it.
He told me he was sorry with all his heart, but he would tell me no lie;
he was sure nothing could be done, and he believed they did it on purpose to vex us;
and so I parted with him: for he said, he could do nothing,
for all the clergy were against us, and nothing could be done at all,
neither did he care to meddle with the paper at all: so I was eager to leave him.
George Whitehead was a saying it might be well,
if we knew the judge who promised you more liberty than before,
that some might speak to him of it, to see if he would do anything in it.

So with my dear love to you, and dear Margaret Fell, John Stubbs,
and the rest of Friends in prison.

Dear George Fox,

My dear and upright love in the Lord salutes you,
and the rest of our dear Friends with you in that prison +++[+++Lancaster Castle,]
and particularly dear Margaret Fell.
The sessions have been here at the Old Bailey and Hicks`'s Hall the last week,
and are not yet over at the Old Bailey.
Judges Hide and Keeling were on the bench,
who have much manifested their enmity against Friends, both in the city and country,
where they have been in their circuits.
Though they were eager against Friends; yet the jury, being some of them moderate,
both excepted against some of the witnesses,
(some of them were Newgate jailers or retainers to them;) as also,
after they were sent out to bring in their sentence upon Friends,
they did not agree upon a verdict, but several of them stood out.
+++[+++_Then follows a similar report of what passed,
to that contained in Ellis Hookes`'s letter next following._]
The last first-day it was much on me to go to the Bull and Mouth meeting,
where many of the halbert ears came to take us;
but they were made to hear me minister near about an hour: afterwards,
came the Mayor and Brown,
and I was permitted to speak a little while after the Mayor came,
before I was pulled down.
They sent me and about forty more to Newgate, and nine or ten to Bridewell.^

As for what was done about your sufferings,
I suppose Gilbert Latey will give you an account; for I abstracted two of your letters,
one was shown to Albany +++[+++Lord Albany (?)], another to March, and another to Anglesea,
and they all seem to dislike the cruelty that is exercised against you.

[.salutation]
Dear Margaret Fell,

My dear love is to you in the unchangeable Truth.
I think it is two weeks since I wrote to you; therefore I could not but write this,
and give you an account of what passed at the Sessions-house this last week.
Yesterday, at Hicks`'s Hall,
four women were sentenced to eleven months`' imprisonment or £40 fine, having husbands;
about twelve or thirteen men and women were sentenced to be transported to any of the
foreign plantations:--and at the Old Bailey about forty-six Friends were called,
and sixteen of them would not answer them (not guilty) according to their form,
and so yesterday were sentenced by the Recorder;--those that had husbands,
to Bridewell for twelve months or £20 fine, and the men were sentenced to Barbados,
and the women-maids to Jamaica.

About sixteen last seventh-day pleaded, and were tried by a jury,
which jury were twice sent out, not agreeing in their verdict:
the judges (Hide and Keeling) talked much to them; but at last they could not agree,
six of them standing very much for Friends.
Some of them pleaded notably on the behalf of Friends, and said,
they did not deny but that they were guilty of meeting at the Bull and Mouth;
but they said, they were not guilty of the fact charged against them, namely,
that it was a seditious meeting; and one of the jury said,
the witnesses were not competent persons (being common
drunkards) to swear against honest men.
So the Judges were very angry with them,
and bound them in £100 bond a-piece to answer it at the King`'s Bench bar.
The four jailers at Newgate were all the witnesses that came in against Friends,
also one of the marshal`'s men.
The Friends at Hertford, that were first sentenced to be banished,
are come back from Gravesend again, and all their goods are set on shore;
and I hear the owners intend to send their ship another way.
They have sentenced twenty-one at Hertford since.

So dear Margaret, my dear love is unto you, and to George Fox,
and John Stubbs and Leonard Fell.
George Whitehead and about three score more were taken at the Bull last first-day,
but everywhere else meetings were quiet.^
footnote:[See a full account in [.book-title]#Sewel`'s History# of the trial of the Friends at Hertford,
before Judge Orlando Bridgman, (vol.
ii. under 1664.) As respects the Friends "`coming back from Gravesend,`" as stated above,
the following particulars concerning them, from [.book-title]#Besse`'s Sufferings,#
are too remarkable to be omitted for a note in this place.
Pursuant to the sentence of banishment passed on these Friends (seven in number),
the jailer acting, it seems, under the order of the Sheriff of Hertfordshire,
proceeded to contract with a master of a vessel bound to the West Indies,
to carry out the Friends accordingly.
{footnote-paragraph-split}
Various
difficulties occurred previous to their being delivered on board the vessel;
and when at length they were brought to the ship,
the master gave them permission under his hand to go ashore,
and to return again when he should require them.
"`On the 1st of October, +++[+++8th month--the month in which the above letter is dated,+++]+++
the master sent for them to come on board, which they did;
and the ship sailed down the river as far as the Redhouse near Deptford;
when a sudden turn of the wind drove her back to Limehouse,
where the prisoners were again set ashore.
On the 6th,
the ship again weighed anchor with wind and tide fair;--yet could not the seamen,
with their utmost application, make this ship sail,
but they were obliged to anchor again about a stone`'s
cast from the place they lay at before;
so that some of the mariners were amazed, and said, '`we shall never get out of England,
while these men are on board!`'`" So they set them ashore the third time.
On the 8th, they sailed again, and went down to Greenwich;
when a sudden storm obliged them to cast anchor again to secure the ship,
and the prisoners were sent on shore the fourth time.
On the 10th, they were ordered on board the fifth time, and sailed again;
when the ship was with much ado kept from running aground:
they however set the prisoners ashore again at Blackwall,
and she went down the same tide to Gravesend.
There the prisoners followed, and by the master`'s order some tarried there,
and others came back to London, till the 28th;
when they were ordered aboard a sixth time, and the ship sailed that night to Leigh road,
where they cast anchor: but before morning the wind turned strong against them,
so that they lay there two days and three nights.
On the 31st, they sailed to the North Foreland, and cast anchor again till the next day.
At night the master set them ashore, and directed them to Deal,
where he met them altogether: and before several witnesses declared,
that though they had followed the ship so long, yet he was resolved not to carry them,
and gave them a certificate in writing as follows: "`Whereas, there were seven men,
called Quakers, brought on board my ship, called the _Anne,_ of London, by William Edmonds,
jailer of Hertford, namely, Nicholas Lucas, Henry Feast, Henry Marshall, Francis Pryor,
John Blendall, Jeremiah Herne, and Samuel Traherne,
all which have continued waiting upon my ship from London to Deal,
from the 14th day of September last till this day;
and I seeing Providence has much crossed me hitherto,
whereby I perceive that the hand of the Lord is against me,
that I dare not proceed on my voyage to carry them, they being innocent persons,
and no crime signified against them worthy of banishment;
and that there is a law in force that no Englishman shall
be carried out of his native country against his will;
and also my men refuse to go the voyage, if I carry them,
which will be much to my hindrance, men being very scarce by reason of the long press.
For these reasons, therefore, and many more, I will not carry them.
These are therefore, to certify any person or persons that shall question them:
that they did not make an escape,
but I will put them on shore again to go where they please.
All this is certified under my hand, this 10th of November,
1664.`"
{footnote-paragraph-split}
+++[+++Witnessed by four persons.+++]+++
"`Thomas May.`"
{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`Being thus set at liberty,
they returned to London, and then to their own homes;
and they sent a letter to the King and Council, stating the circumstance,
and accompanied it with a copy of the ship-master`'s certificate.
This letter being read at the Council board produced an order; which,
after setting forth the fact of their having been put on board the aforesaid ship,
pursuant to their sentence of transportation,
and having been by the master set ashore at the Downs,
'`leaving them at liberty to go where they pleased;
and it appearing to be matter of contrivance and design between
the said master and the persons before mentioned;`' it was ordered
that the High Sheriff do again apprehend and secure them,
'`until means of transporting them can be made by some shipping bound unto those parts.`'`"
{footnote-paragraph-split}
By this order they were again committed to prison,
and remained there seven years,
until discharged by the King`'s proclamation.--[.book-title]#Besse`'s Sufferings,# vol, i, p, 246--248.]

Dear Margaret,

Last first-day our meetings were quiet in all places in and about this city,
the Bull excepted; where they took twelve, who were committed.
Since I wrote last to you, there were three Friends shipped in order to be transported,
of whom I think T. S. gave you an account:
the ship is gone (for all I hear) from the Downs.^
footnote:[One of these Friends, soon after he reached the ship, died,
as appears by the following entry in our Registers of Burials for London: "`Robert Hayes,
who for Truth`'s sake suffered many weeks`' imprisonment in Newgate;
after which he being carried from there (with two more) on ship board in order to banishment,
they being taken out of their hot beds without an hour`'s warning,
and exposed to the sharp air of a cold morning on the water, he departed this life,
(not having spoken many words after he came on board
the ship,) about the 26th day of the first month,
1665:
the cause of his death appearing to lie in the unrighteous proceedings of his persecutors;
and was interred in the aforesaid burying ground.`" +++[+++Bunhill Fields.+++]+++
{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`I knew this Robert Hayes,
+++[+++writes George Whitehead,+++]+++
he was a very innocent, loving man, a goodlike person, had a fresh comely countenance,
seemed healthy, and in his prime and strength when first imprisoned.
I was very sorrowfully affected,
when I heard how quickly he was dispatched out of the world,
by the shameful cruelty and inhuman usage inflicted upon him by those
merciless persecutors.`"--George Whiteheads`'s [.book-title]#Christian Progress#]
Last seventh-day Thomas Salthouse with J. Moore went to Kingston,
where they were taken at a meeting, and several others; and are committed,
some for not giving bond, (as I hear,)--the rest for a month.

Things in relation to Truth here, are as well as can be,
considering how the power of darkness is set against us;
and Friends remain still in prison.
There is great fear that we shall lose the Bull and Mouth;
they go to trial this term about it, and it is to be tried in the King`'s Bench:
the Truth is like to suffer much, by the loss of it;
for it is and has been so noted and public a meeting place,
that it has been very serviceable.

Dear Margaret,

I received your letter, and I have spoken to Gilbert +++[+++Latey(?)]
who says, he believes it has been Kirby`'s^
footnote:[Colonel Kirby of Kirby Hall, five miles from Swarthmore;
he was the magistrate who caused George Fox to be so severely treated in Lancaster Castle.
In his [.book-title]#Journal# under this date George Fox writes--"`After
the court sessions at Lancaster were over,
+++[+++at which George Fox defended his case so skillfully,]
Colonel Kirby and some other justices were very uneasy with my being at Lancaster,
(for I had galled them sore at my trials there;) and they laboured
much to get me removed from there to some remote place.
Colonel Kirby threatened that I should be sent far enough,
and sometimes he said I should be sent beyond the seas.
So about six weeks after the court sessions they got an order from the King and Council,
to remove me from Lancaster; and with it they brought a letter from the Earl of Anglesea,
wherein was written, that if those things were found true against me,

Last first-day our meetings here were quiet, only at the Bull they pulled them out,
and let them go.
I hear the King sent an order,
that there should be no more sent to Newgate by reason of the plague,
which increases here very much, thirty dying of it last week as I hear.
Friends are kept close in Newgate,--now about seven score.
There is a report of sending away eight more shortly.

[.salutation]
Dear Mary,

In the fellowship of life I dearly salute you; in which you may feel me,
if you should never more see me:
for I have received my mortal life several times of late from the hand of the Lord,
and through faith in his power; for when the messenger of death would have entered,
it has been driven back.
And blessed be His name, who has kept me, and nineteen more here in this close place,
all in health, above these five weeks;
notwithstanding three have been buried out of this prison of the sickness.
But dreadful and terrible is the hand of the Lord upon all flesh in this wicked city;
and which is the same upon the nation in general:
and although it has hitherto fell heavily upon the poorer sort of people,
yet the dregs of the cup are reserved for the fat ones, and the high ones,
and the proud ones, and the very oppressors.
And good is the hand of the Lord to his own, whose death is gain:--Blessed are they,
who in the day time have laboured diligently; now night comes,
they lie down in rest and peace: but for the idle, night has surprised them as a snare,
before they have arrived at Salem, the city of peace.

There is a terrible cry;--and indeed the miseries that are upon many here,
are hardly to be uttered: and yet wickedness is little abated in the persecutors,
but they are rather worse in cruelty;
for they have found out a new way to murder the innocent
and others that they account enemies,
by thronging them into infected prisons;
and so their cruelty executes them in a short time.
Two captains and a lieutenant died here; and several more are here,
and nothing is laid to their charge.
Many are deceased aboard the ship of the banished Friends.
Six of them taken within the Peel and sent to Newgate have left the body,
and about thirty more out of both sides +++[+++of that
prison (?)]. I suppose you heard Turner is dead;
Samuel Fisher and John Shield are deceased, and very many Friends.
Many doctors of medicine who made a great ado about stopping the disease, are dead,
and several priests: several Friends are deceased out of the White Lion Prison.
Friends are kept out of the Bull,
and the Mayor caused the door to be boarded up close with thick boards;
but I think the other meetings are quiet.
The sickness breaks out exceedingly hot in the city,
and thousands more die than are in the bills of mortality, as I am certainly informed.
Fugge the wicked master of the ship is yet in the Counter.^
footnote:[He was arrested and imprisoned for debt,
before he could set sail.--See [.book-title]#Sewel`'s History,# Index [.book-title]#Fugge.#]
Exceedingly great is the exercise of Friends here,
that none knows but those who are in it.

My dear love salutes your husband, etc.
Your true friend and brother,

footnote:[This collection deposited in London,
consists of four volumes of letters and documents of Isaac Penington`'s;

+++[+++George Whitehead, who, it appears,
remained in or near the city during this terrible visitation, thus writes:

"`It was a time of great calamity, sorrow and heaviness, to many thousands of all sorts;
and that which added to our Friends`' affliction was,
the hardness of our persecutors`' hearts,--their cruelty and barbarity,
in imprisoning and detaining so many of them in Newgate,
and in the White Lion prison in Southwark, after the plague was greatly broken forth,
and many people swept away thereby.`"
George Whitehead proceeds: "`I had not then freedom, satisfaction or peace,
to leave the city, or Friends in and about London,
in that time of such great and general calamity--no,
not when the mortality was at its height;
but was concerned and given up in spirit to stay among them,
to attend to Friends`' meetings, to visit Friends in prison, and at their own houses;
even when many of them lay sick of the contagion,
both in prison and at their habitations.

"`And in all that time the Lord preserved me by his power, through faith,
from that infectious distemper; which mercy I esteemed great and wonderful,
and hope ever thankfully to remember,
in a living sense of the same divine hand which upheld and preserved me.
I well remember,
that although it was judged the prisons were then infected and poisoned with the contagion,
I was freely given up to suffer imprisonment;
and on first-days I took my night cap in my pocket when I went to meetings,
not knowing but I might be apprehended at some meeting, and committed to prison.
However, the Lord gave me faith to be resigned to his will,
either to live or to die for his name and Truth`'s sake; and,
through all those dangers and difficulties,
to bear my testimony in faithfulness to his blessed power and light of righteousness;
and thereby sustained and wonderfully preserved my life,
when the cry and sound of mortality was round about us,
from one end and side of the city to another.`"

After this visitation had subsided,
George Whitehead wrote an affectionate address to his Friends,
which is given at large in his Christian Progress (p. 301:)
it is entitled [.book-title]#This is an Epistle for the Remnant of Friends,
and Chosen of God,
Whom He Has Yet Preserved to Bear Their Testimony In and About the City of London, 1665.#
The following extract from this Epistle is thought worthy of being here added:--

"`The life, peace, satisfaction and comfort, that many innocent Friends felt,
and that some expressed and signified on their death beds, I am a living witness of;
having several times (as the Lord has drawn me in
his love,) been present with many of them,
when they were very low in the outward man, and with several when upon their death beds,
both in that destructive place Newgate, and some other places.
Indeed, when sorrow and sadness have seized upon my spirit,
and my heart and soul have been pierced and wounded,
at the sad sufferings of so many harmless lambs,
when they were on their sick beds in these noisome holes and prisons;
yet at the same time having had a deep sense and knowledge
of the Lord`'s love and care to them in that condition,
and having truly felt his life and power stirring among them,--this, on the other hand,
has refreshed and revived my spirit;
knowing that Christ their salvation and redemption was manifest to and in them,
though in that suffering state,
as they have followed and obeyed Him through sufferings and tribulations.
With such to live was Christ, even in that state, and to die was gain;
it being through death that the Lord had appointed the final deliverance of many,
from the cruelties and rod of their oppressors,
and from the miseries and evil to come.`"^
footnote:[The state of London during this dreadful visitation,
seems to have been most deplorable.
The following striking description is taken from [.book-title]#Ellis`'s Original Letters in the British Museum;#
the letter is addressed to Dr. Sancroft from J. Tillison, and is dated Sept.
14th, 1665,
four days previous to the date of the above letter from
Morgan Watkins:--"`The desolation of the city is very great.
That heart is either of steel or stone, that will not lament this sad visitation,
and will not bleed for those unutterable woes!--What eye would not weep,
to see so many habitations uninhabited,--the poor sick not
visited,--the hungry not fed,--the grave not satisfied!
Death stares us continually in the face,
in every infected person that passes by us,--in every coffin
which is daily and hourly carried along the streets.
The custom was in the beginning, to bury the dead in the night only;
but now both night and day will hardly be time enough to do it.
The Quakers (as we are informed) have buried in their piece of ground
a thousand for some weeks together last past.`"]--[.book-title]#Christian Progress#]

London, 7th of 9th month, +++[+++11th month]
1665.

[.salutation]
Dear Margaret Fell,

My dear love is to you and to all your dear children.
I have been preserved well, but as a brand is plucked out of the fire,
so has the Lord delivered me; for I have often laid down my head in sorrow,
and rose as I went to bed, and not slept a wink, for the groans of them that lay dying;
and every morning I counted it a great mercy that the Lord gave me another day.

They keep us out of the meeting at the Bull on the first and fourth-days,
but on the fifth-days we meet therein.
Last first-day, they carried Esther Biddle and another woman to prison,
for speaking in the street, and struck Esther over the face with their halberts.
Our meetings are quiet everywhere else.
Friends are generally well,^
footnote:[The reader will doubtless have apprehended the meaning,
in which the term "`being well`" seems to have been used in these letters,--namely,
in a religious sense:--in the case before us,
Friends were probably in the midst of the most severe sufferings
and acute trials as to the outward man,--in prison--in the ship,
etc.; and yet the acknowledgment is made, that they were "`generally well.`"]
both in prison, in the ship, and at Newgate, and those that are at liberty;
and not above one a-day buried; whereas there used to be sixteen or eighteen,
and sometimes twenty a-day buried; for several weeks together it was so.
These are a list of the names of them that died in Newgate and in the ship;
which yet remains where it did.

+++[+++While the plague was raging in the city, "`our persecutors +++[+++writes George Whitehead]
took fifty-five of our Friends (men and women) out of Newgate,
where the distemper also prevailed;
and forced them on board a ship called the _Black Eagle,_ in order for banishment;
which ship lay for some time in the river.
They were so crowded on board, and the distemper breaking out among them,
most of them were infected,
and twenty-seven of them soon died.`"--"`I visited these Friends
(continues George Whitehead,) and had a meeting with them on board;
and the Lord my God preserved me, both from the distemper, and also from banishment;
wherein I did humbly confess his power and special providence,
to His own praise and glory.`" +++[+++Whitehead`'s [.book-title]#Christian Progress.#]
The ship, after considerable detention, at length sailed;
but was taken in the channel by a Dutch privateer:
and sailing round by the North of Ireland and Scotland to avoid re-capture,
the vessels at length reached Holland where the Friends
(one half of their number having previously died,
as stated above,) were set at liberty by the Dutch,
and afterwards all but one returned to England.

With regard to the number of deaths by the plague among Friends in the metropolis,
the following abstract account from our burial registers for London will show the amount:
the report contained in the letter to Dr. Sancroft,
is manifestly erroneous as regards the burials of Friends;
but it is not improbable that many bodies were allowed to
be buried in the Friends`' burying ground without any ceremonials.]

Under the Plague are included in this list the cases reported to
be of "`the Sickness,`" "`the Visitation,`" "`the Common Distemper;`"
but not the "`Spotted Fever,`" of which many cases occurred,
and were doubtless often a modification of the plague.
The first entry in the 4th month is "`Henry Stokes of Stepney, died 24th of 4th month,
of the Plague; as the searchers of the said parish reported.`"
The last entry observed of the Plague is on the 19th of 10th month of this year.
"`During the fore-part of the of period the cases of deaths by the plague,
are reported by the searchers; but when about at its greatest height,
these reports of diseases by the searchers do not occur in general,
but the entry is made simply of the Plague, etc.

The total number of deaths registered for this year, +++[+++1665]
as stated above, is: _1177._ The same for 1666 is _106_;
for 1667, _121_; for 1668, _171_; for 1678 (ten years later), _300_.

The number of deaths of members only, for ten years ending 1811,
within the then six monthly meetings of London is reported to be 501,
or about 50 per annum, and the number of members of these meetings in 1811,
is reported to have been 2270;
from such data it is not improbable that the population of Friends
for the same district in 1678 might be about 10,000,
calculating upon a proportionably heavier ratio of mortality for that early period.

I suppose you heard of our releasement a while since: I have been somewhat weak,
since I came out into the air;
for through the great love of my God I am wonderfully preserved,
to the praise of his name.
But the two imprisonments in Newgate and the one at the Gatehouse,
have much weakened my body, in which I have had several battles with death;
but the power of my God arising,
gave me dominion over the distemper and weakness of the flesh.
The day was dreadful to all flesh, and few were able to abide it,
and stand in the judgment: but the Lord was very merciful to the remnant of his people,
and his blessed seed is arising in many vessels.
Our meetings are quiet, save only the Bull and Mouth, which is kept out:
they are beginning to be very large of strange faces and good honest countenances,
who with exceeding hungerings receive the Truth.
Gilbert Latey is in health, and Amos Stoddart, but he has buried his wife.
Alexander Parker is at Bristol.
There is no stranger Friend here at present but myself, and the work is very great.
George Whitehead is in Essex.--William Caton is out of the body, +++[+++deceased,]
as was so related to me two days since.

The city does begin to fill again.
I have account of 920 Friends and Friends`' children and servants,
that were buried in our burial place, since the 25th of the 1st month 1665;
but I think not much above half were Friends.
The ship and Friends are yet in the river; and all in Newgate are pretty well, and have,
much liberty.--The Bishop of Salisbury is dead;
and this day I heard that Canterbury was dead, but I am not certain; and also another,
but his name I know not.

So at present I rest your truly loving friend and brother,
in the fellowship of the everlasting Gospel.

[.salutation]
Dear Margaret Fell,

My dear love in the Truth is unto you.
I have lately been in the country, which is the cause of my not writing to you.

People are in a great confusion here, by reason of the fire which happened in this city,
to the great destruction and ruin of the same;
which has not been without a just cause of provocation of the Lord by this generation;
who have lifted up themselves against the Lord and
their hearts have been given up to pride and vanity,
and not to seek the Lord; but rather to persecute them that were true seekers of Him,
and who delighted in his ways.
There was a young man that came out of Huntingdonshire,
to warn the King to set Friends at liberty; or else, within two days,
destruction should be.^
footnote:[See George Whitehead`'s [.book-title]#Christian Progress,# p. 314.]
He went to Whitehall the day before the fire;
but they would not admit him to come to the King: but the next morning he went again,
and was admitted to speak to him in the presence-chamber.
Here was last week another man Friend,
who came out of Staffordshire to speak with the King,
and to deliver a pay +++[+++a paper or list (?)]
to him; and indeed a very plain and honest man he is, and he had a great weight upon him:
and going towards Whitehall last sixth-day morning betimes, he met the King in his coach,
(as it was supposed) going a hunting.
And he stepped to the coach side, and laid his hand upon it, and said: "`King Charles,
my message is this day unto you, in the behalf of God`'s poor, afflicted,
suffering people;`" and gave him his pay,
(which indeed were weighty words,) and pressed him on to read it.
The King said, "`How do you think I can read it now?`"
So he told the King that his message was unto him,--"`that the
people of God might have their liberty from under the great bondage,
that you and your law has laid upon them.`"

Then the King replied and said, that he and his Parliament were to consider of it.
The Friend told him, "`if they did so consider of it,
as to set the afflicted people of the Lord at liberty,
it might be a means to stop the judgments of the Lord; but if so be,
that they did continue their bonds,
the Lord God would multiply his judgments the more upon them.`"
Then the Friend moved the sufferings of Friends at Reading,
and told him that their sufferings did cry very much in the ears of the Lord against him;
and except he set them at liberty from under the cruel law of premunire,
their cries would not be stopped, but would be turned double upon his head.
Then the King said, that they would not obey the law of the nation.
Then the Friend told him, that if so be,
he and his Parliament would make a law _equal_ to the law of God,
then he might try whether they would walk contrary to that;
and so pressed him to set Friends at liberty,
or else the Lord would bring worse judgments upon him.
And he told him, that the Lord had pleaded with, this city, with plagues, sword,
and with fire; and so left him.
When he came to the coach side, the footman took off his hat;
but the King bid him give the man his hat again, and was very mild and moderate.

So this is the most at present.--His name is Adam Barfoote.

I saved your book from the fire, and last seventh-day I gave it to W. Warwick.^
footnote:[The narratives given in the diaries of Evelyn and Pepys,
(who were eye witnesses,) of the great fire of London, are sad indeed.
Evelyn writes: "`Sept.
3+++.+++ The fire continued all this night (if I may call that night,
which was light as day for ten miles round about,) after a dreadful manner--when
conspiring with a fierce eastern wind in a very dry season.
I went on foot to the (Bank side in Southwark,) and saw the whole
south part of the city burning from Cheapside to the Thames,
and all along Cornhill, Tower Street, Fen-church Street, Gracious Street,
and so along to Bainard`'s Castle, and was now taking hold of St. Street,
Fen-church Street, Gracious Street, and so along to Bainard`'s Castle,
and was now taking hold of St. Paul`'s Church.
The conflagration was so universal, and the people so astonished,
that from the beginning,
(I know not by what despondency or fate,) they hardly stirred to quench it;
so that there was nothing heard or seen but crying out and lamentation,
and running about like distracted creatures.
Oh! the miserable and calamitous spectacle! such as haply the world
had not seen the like since the foundation of it,
nor to be outdone till the universal conflagration.
All the sky was of a fiery aspect like the top of a burning oven;
the light being seen above forty miles round about for many nights.
The poor inhabitants were dispersed about St. George`'s Fields and Moorfields,
as far as Highgate, and several miles in circle; some under tents,
some under miserable huts and hovels, many without a rag or necessary utensils,
bed or board; who, from delicateness, riches,
and easy accommodations in stately and well furnished houses,
were now reduced to extremest misery and poverty,`" etc. vol. i. p. 372--374.]

[.salutation]
Dear Margaret Fell,

Though for some time I have been silent in this manner of speaking to you by writing,
yet is not my love in any measure diminished, but rather augmented to you;
and I often remember you in your sufferings;
and you (with all the faithful in Christ) are dear and near unto me.
I hope you are, as formerly,
sensible of the integrity and innocent true simplicity of my heart,
both towards God and all his people; for Truth is my delight,
and in the work and service of God I labour:
it is my food and drink to do the will of God,
and therein I am fully resolved to continue, even to the end.

I have for some time been in and about Bristol,
where the work of God is still very precious, as dear Thomas Salthouse can inform you.
Since my departure from there,
I have had good service on the Lord`'s behalf in several parts of Wiltshire and at Reading,
where Friends are generally well, but kept prisoners as formerly.
Ann Curtis is at liberty, but Thomas Curtis, and G. Lamboll,
and J. Cole with his two brothers, and about thirty-two or thirty-three more,
are prisoners.
At Wycomb I was also, where Friends at present are in health.
John Raunce has been much exercised in his family; five died out of it of the sickness,
and his two daughters were near death, but are recovered:
at present he and his family are well, and go abroad again.
I was at Aylesbury to visit Isaac Penington and the prisoners there, four in all,
who were well; from there I passed to Amersham, and so to Kingston,
where I was taken prisoner and committed for seven days.

On fourth-day last, I came to this sad ruined city,
the sight whereof did sadden my spirit;
considering that the end of woes are not yet come: but in the will of God I am satisfied,
knowing assuredly, that in, through, and over all these things,
Truth shall arise and prosper, and shall be exalted forever and ever.
Great fears have taken hold of the hearts of thousands here,
and great talk there has been of a bloody massacre intended by the papists,
which has raised great contests in the Houses of Parliament;
and this day is a proclamation come forth against them:
it is like it will not be long before you see the contents of it.

Friends here are generally well, and meetings thronging full and very peaceable.
George Fox is not yet come into the city; last sixth-day at night he lay at Aylesbury,
and on the seventh-day intended to pass to William Barber`'s, four miles from Albans:
he was expected here this night; we hope he will be here very shortly.
We be pretty many of the labouring brethren in the city, to, wit, George Whitehead,
John Whitehead, Thomas Loe, Josiah Coale, Thomas Rolfe, and myself.
I this day received a letter from Thomas Salthouse; if with you,
remember my dear love to him, and to John and Margaret Rouse, Sarah, Mary, Susan,
and Rachel Fell, with all the rest of your family and friends,
who love and obey the Truth.
My heart in the true love of God is knit unto you all; in which I bid you farewell;
and rest,

[.signed-section-closing]
Your brother in the Truth that lives forever.

Dearly Beloved,

All Friends here are well in general, and our meetings very full and peaceable at present.
As concerning Friends`' proceedings at the Court,
at present I need not say anything of it, for E. Stubbs, it is like, will inform you.
What may be done, I know not: but the Lord`'s will be done,
into whose will and living power, I, with many more, am wholly and freely given up,
and to what He sees good for us; knowing by good experience to our great comfort,
that He will allow no more to be laid on us, than what he will also enable us to bear.

George Fox we hear, is come to Berkshire, and is expected to be here this week.
There are but few Friends in the ministry here now, but John Burnyeat and Josiah Coale,
who came last seventh-day.

William Callow.^
footnote:[In [.book-title]#Besse`'s Sufferings,# chap.
20, under "`Isle of Man,`" is a long and sad narrative of the cruel persecutions,
to which this Friend, William Callow, his wife and family, were subjected.
Repeated attempts were made,
at the instigation chiefly of the Bishop of the Island and the Governor,
to banish this Friend and others;
but they were again and again sent back to the Island by
order of magistrates of the districts in England and Ireland,
where they had been sent.
In 1666, William Callow came to London,
and obtained from the Prince Rupert a letter to the Earl of Derby,
interceding on his behalf;
in which William Callow is described as an ancient tenant of the Earl in the Isle of Man,
and who "`is now, it seems, turned Quaker, and for that reason banished the country.`"
"`If (adds the Prince) there be no more in it than being a Quaker,
I do presume your Lordship may be inclined to restore
him and his family to their ancient possessions;
and that you may please to do so,
is the reason of my giving your Lordship this trouble.`"--The Earl`'s
reply is conclusive against the application,--briefly stating that
he would not have the island infected with schism;
it being then clear, as he said, of Quakers and Dissenters.
The account of the severe persecutions against this
Friend and the few others in that island,
occupy several folio pages of Besse;
who concludes the same with the following paragraph:--"`Thus
have we traversed an almost unparalleled series of persecutions,
carried on many years together, by the arbitrary power of an inexorable prelate,
against a Christian and harmless people,
for no other cause than the exercise of pure religion,
and keeping of a conscience void of offence both toward God and man.`"
{footnote-paragraph-split}
The
letter of William Callow has upon it a seal with this motto,
"`1660. God above keep us in his light and love,`"--the rest broken off.
{footnote-paragraph-split}
One
of Richard Farnworth`'s letters had a seal with a skull,
and the subscription __"`Memento mori:`"__ very generally the initials of writer`'s
names are contained on the seals:--"`a flaming sword,`" with his initials,
was upon one of George Fox`'s seals,
which he left specially with other articles in his will.]

Dear Sister,

We have had several precious meetings, since the General Meeting,
for the gathering of those that are gone astray;
in which the power and glory so irresistibly broke in upon them,
that many of them were very much broken,
and gave open testimonies against that spirit which
had seduced them from the unity of Friends,
very much to the satisfaction of the faithful:
and the power wrought so effectually among them,
that Friends had little need to set forth the evil of the courses they had followed;
for they themselves gave sufficient testimony of the evil thereof:
and the hearts of Friends were so enlarged towards them,
that I believe there will be meetings appointed for the gathering of them,
so long as any, that are honest among them, are left ungathered.

[.signed-section-closing]

and of Rachel going to Shacklewell school.

"`for instructing girls and young maidens in whatever things
were civil and useful in the creation.`"--[.book-title]#Journal# (1667.)]

[.offset]
+++[+++_From the original apparently._]

+++[+++George Fox in his [.book-title]#Journal,# under date of this year, writes:
"`We had great service at London this year, and the Lord`'s Truth came over all;
and many that had been out from Truth, came in again this year,
confessing and condemning their former outgoings.`"
And again,--"`several meetings we had with them,
and the Lord`'s everlasting power was over all,
and set judgment on the head of that which had run out.
In these meetings, which lasted whole days,
several who had run out with John Perrot and others, came in again;
and condemned that spirit which led them with him
to keep on their hats when Friends prayed,
and when they themselves prayed.
Some of them said, that--if Friends had not stood, they had been gone,
and had fallen into perdition.`"

Thomas Ellwood also mentions the "`memorable meeting appointed to be held in London,
through a Divine opening in the motion of life,
in that eminent servant and prophet of God, George Fox;
for the restoring and bringing in again those who had gone out from Truth,
and the holy unity of Friends therein, by the means and ministry of John Perrot.`"
([.book-title]#Life,# p. 253)

The brief allusion to the subject of this General Meeting in the foregoing letter,
comprehends much that is striking and instructive:--further
extracts from Thomas Ellwood upon the same subject,
well deserve to be here added.
After giving some information respecting John Perrot and his notions,
Thomas Ellwood proceeds to confess,
that in the time of his own infancy and weakness of judgment as to Truth,
he was himself caught "`in that snare:--but the Lord in tender compassion to my soul,
was graciously pleased to open my understanding,
and give me a clear sight of the enemy`'s design in this work and drew me off from it.`"
"`But when that solemn meeting was appointed at London,
for a travail of spirit in behalf of those who had thus gone out,
that they might rightly return,
and be sensibly received into the unity of the body again,--my spirit rejoiced,
and with gladness of heart I went to it; as did many more of both city and country;
and with great simplicity and humility of mind,
did honestly and openly acknowledge our outgoing,
and take condemnation and shame to ourselves.`"

"`Thus in the motion of life were the healing waters stirred; and many,
through the virtuous power thereof, were restored to soundness; and indeed,
not many were lost.
And though most of these who thus returned, were such as, with myself,
had before renounced the error and forsaken the practice; yet did we sensibly find,
that forsaking without confessing, (in case of public scandal,) was not sufficient:
but that an open acknowledgment (of open offences,) as well as forsaking them,
was necessary to the obtaining complete remission.`"--[.book-title]#Life,# p. 255, 256]

Dear George Fox,

My dear love in the everlasting Truth is unto you and to Margaret Fell.
This is to let you know,
that yesterday morning our dear friend Joseph Fuce laid down the body at Kingston.

This day week the Parliament comes to sit:
I thought we might have seen you here about that time.
An account of Friends sufferings printed and given them,
might be very serviceable at their first coming together.
I hear the Bishops intend to have a new act made against us, if they can,
at the Parliament; the first offence to be imprisonment,
and the second offence confiscation of goods.^
footnote:[Both Houses of Parliament, in the spring this year,
addressed the King to suppress Conventicles in and near London and Westminster.
The next year, 1670, they proceeded to renew the Act against Conventicles,
after a lapse of three years from its expiration.
It is remarkable how earnestly both Houses of Parliament pressed on this work of persecution.
The King however once more issued his declaration of indulgence in 1672;
and at the meeting of Parliament in 1673,
the House of Commons again took into consideration the King`'s declaration of indulgence,
and presented another address or rather a remonstrance against it; after which the King,
desirous to please the House, again revoked it in 1673-4.]

Dear Margaret Fox,

My dear love to you in the everlasting Truth,
which is much in my heart that I cannot express.
I received your letter from Bristol,
and shall be as ready to answer your desire to write to you sometimes as ever;
for I honour you,--very dear you are unto me as ever in the precious Truth.
I parted with George Fox, but now I have been with him all this day; he is very well.
I received a letter yesterday from Arthur Cotton at Plymouth, and he informs me,
that there lately arrived at that place, several Friends from beyond sea, namely,
Robert Hodgson, Christopher Bacon and Christopher Holder,
Ann Clayton and two other women Friends.
Ann and the other women and Christopher Holder are gone towards Bristol.

Yesterday, there was a Friend with the King, one that is John Grove`'s mate:^
footnote:[John Grove is spoken of by Thomas Ellwood in his Life
(under date 1670,) as a choice Friend and sailor of London,
who was master of a vessel, and who traded to the island of Barbados.
He carried out a son of Isaac Penington, who fell overboard on the voyage home,
and was lost.--See [.book-title]#The Life of Thomas Ellwood.#]
he was the man that was mate to the master of the fisher-boat,
that carried the King away, when he went from Worcester fight;
and only this Friend and the master knew of it in the ship:
and the Friend carried him +++[+++the King]
ashore on his shoulders.
The King knew him again, and was very friendly to him; and told him he remembered him,
and of several things that were done in the ship at the same time.
The Friend told him,
the reason why he did not come forward all this while was,--that he was satisfied,
in that he had peace and satisfaction in himself,
that he did what he did to relieve a man in distress: and now he desired nothing of him,
but that he would set Friends at liberty, who were great sufferers, or to that purpose;
and told the King he had a pay +++[+++_supposed a list_]
of 110 that were premunired, that had lain in prison about six years,
and none can release them but him.
So the King took the pay,--and said, there were many of them,
and that they would be in again in a month`'s time;
and that the country gentlemen complained to him,
that they were so troubled with the Quakers.
So he said, he would release him six; but the Friend thinks to go to him again,
for he had not fully +++[+++_word not clear, supposed to mean_ relieved]
himself.

All things are well and quiet here in relation to the Truth.
I am in haste, and cannot write so large as I may when I have more time, it being late;
but rest

+++[+++The particulars described in the foregoing letter,
of what passed at this interview with the King, are curious and interesting, and,
it might be said, full of character.
On the restoration of the King,
many and earnest were the applications for favours and pensions,
by those who had hopes of making out any case of
personal service towards the monarch in his distress,
at a time when a large Parliamentary premium was set upon his head,
and during his extraordinary escape from this country in 1654.
This accounts for the remark of the Friend (probably
in reply,) why he did not come forward earlier.^
footnote:[Nine years had elapsed since the King`'s restoration.]
The honest simplicity of his answer,
and his appeal to the King on behalf of his suffering brethren in the jails,
will doubtless not be lost upon the reflecting reader.

From a volume entitled [.book-title]#The Boscobel Tracts,
Relating to the Escape of Charles the 2nd After the Battle of Worcester,#
re-published in 1830, the following particulars are extracted,
which seem at all to bear upon the occurrence mentioned in the foregoing letter;
they are taken from that part of the work which contains
the King`'s own account of his escape,
as dictated to S. Pepys.
After describing his reaching Brighthelmstone,
through a succession of very extraordinary escapes from discovery,
the King goes on to state--"`About four in the morning,
myself and the company before named, went towards Shoreham,
taking the master of the ship with us on horseback, behind one of our company;
and came to the vessel`'s side, which was not above sixty tons.
But it being low water, and the vessel lying dry,
I and Lord Wilmot got up with a ladder into her,
and went and lay down in the little cabin, till the tide came to fetch us off.`"
Their approach to the French coast is thus described.
"`We stood over to the coast of France, the wind being then full north;
and the next morning a little before day we saw the coast.
But the tide failing us, and the wind coming about to the S. W.,
we were forced to come to and anchor within two miles from the shore,
till the tide of flood was done.
We found ourselves just before a harbour in France called Fescamp;
and just as the tide of ebb was made, caught sight of a vessel to leeward of us,
which by her nimble working, I suspected to be an Ostend privateer.
Upon which I went to my Lord Wilmot, and telling him my opinion of that ship,
proposed to him our going ashore in the little cock boat, for fear they should prove so:
we accordingly both went ashore in the cock boat,
and the next day got to Rouen.`"--[.book-title]#Boscobel Tracts,# p. 163.

It seems probable from this account, that the tide failing, the King was carried ashore,
as usual, on the shoulders of a sailor--the Friend;
whose name George Fox gives us in his endorsement of the letter; namely, Richard Carver.]

[.salutation]
Dear Margaret Fox,

My dear love is unto you in the unchangeable Truth,
even the same as it was from the beginning;
the Truth is my life and delight above all things in this world.
I have the most cause of any man to remember the Lord`'s love to me,
because I have partaken of so many mercies both inwardly and outwardly,
blessed be his name forever! my heart is every day engaged more and more unto him:
and the more I taste, the more I desire of his love and kindness.

The chief cause of my writing is, to give you an account how it is with us.
I do judge that you have heard before this,
how George Fox was taken on the first-day after the act came forth, at Gracious street,
for speaking in the court to the people.
The mayor was very civil to him.^
footnote:[See [.book-title]#George Fox`'s Journal# under date 1669-1670,
for a detailed account of his arrest on this occasion.]
The last first-day the meetings were very quiet everywhere, except at Gracious street:
they took W. Warwick, and had him before the mayor, who fined him:
all else was quiet within doors, and very full meetings;
and every day else this week all was very quiet,
and within doors in all places in and about the city.
Last first-day they broke up Watson`'s meeting, the Presbyterian,
at Devonshire House:--I stood by, and saw them take three away before the Mayor;
one of them seemed to be a young non-conforming priest.^
footnote:[This was a period of renewed severities and persecutions against Friends,
and also other dissenters.
The Act against Conventicles of 1664, continued in force for three years or thereabouts:
many were the sufferings of our Friends under the operation of this cruel law.
"`The execution of it,`" (George Whitehead remarks) "`tended to the great oppression
and ruin of many of the King`'s innocent peaceable subjects and families,
especially of the people called Quakers, whom the persecutors in that three years`' time,
(while the said act was in force,) furiously endeavoured to rid the nation of by banishment,
or to force them to conform to that church, whereof those persecutors were members.`"
In the year 1670, this act was again renewed:
it received the Royal assent on the "`11th of April,`" and came
into force the "`10th of May,`" answering to the 10th of 3rd month,
1670.
There were clauses added to this renewed act, of yet greater rigour than before;
it was to be "`construed most largely and beneficially for the suppressing of Conventicles,
and for the justification and encouragement of all
persons to be employed in the execution thereof.`"
+++[+++__--Extract from the Act.__+++]+++
"`The agents chiefly employed for that work, were generally a company of idle,
profligate, and mercenary informers,`" who were thus let loose upon Friends:
one-third of the fines imposed by the act, being set down to the informer,
in cases of conviction.`"
{footnote-paragraph-split}
"`Thus were we exposed and laid open by a law,
to be devoured by beasts of prey, (writes William Crouch,) and neither our own innocency,
nor our own houses (according to the old maxim in law,
a man`'s house being his castle) could defend us,
or preserve us from being ruined by unreasonable and wicked men.`"
{footnote-paragraph-split}
Neale, in his [.book-title]#History of the Puritans,#
speaking of the cruel consequences of this Act against Conventicles,
thus expresses himself: "`Great numbers were prosecuted under this act,
and many industrious families reduced to poverty.`"--"`The act
was executed with such severity in Starling`'s Mayorality +++[+++in London,+++]+++
that many of the trading men of the city were removing with their effects to Holland,
till the King put a stop to it: informers were everywhere at work,
and having crept into religious assemblies in disguise,
they levied great sums of money upon minister and people.`"
In an Archbishop`'s letter to his Bishops in this day, (quoted by Neale,) he thus writes,
in allusion to the act and its effects: "`I have confidence under God,
that if we do our parts now at first seriously, by the assistance of the civil power,
considering the abundant care and provision the act contains for our advantage,
we shall in a few months see so great an alteration in the distraction of these times,`"--"`as
that the seduced people would be returning from their seditious and self-seeking teachers,
to the unity of the Church,`" etc. etc.
{footnote-paragraph-split}
After alluding to the various contrivances of the non-conformist
ministers to evade the effects of this act,
Neale proceeds to describe the conduct of Friends under it.
"`The behaviour of the Quakers was very extraordinary,
and had something in it that looked like the spirit of martyrdom.
They met at the same place and hour as in times of liberty;
and when the officers came to seize them, none of them would stir;
they went all together to prison; they stayed there till they were dismissed,
for they would not petition to be set at liberty, nor pay the fines set upon them,
nor so much as the prison fees.
When they were discharged, they went to their meetinghouse again as before;
and when the doors were shut by order,
they assembled in great numbers in the street before the doors; saying,
they would not be ashamed, nor afraid,

but in imitation of the prophet Daniel, they would do it the more publicly,
because they were forbid.

Dear Sister,

Meetings yesterday were pretty quiet, to what they have been sometimes.
I was yesterday at Gracious-street meeting,
which was in the street;--and as near as I could judge several thousands were at it;
but by reason of the multitude of rude people who came mostly to gaze,
it was more like a tumult than a solid assembly; which was no small grief to me to see.
William Penn was there, and spoke most that was spoken:
there were some watchmen with halberts,
and musketeers came to take him down while he was speaking;
but the multitude crowded so close about him, that they could not come to him:
but to prevent further disturbance, he promised, when the meeting was done,
to come to them; and so he and one Mead +++[+++William]
who is lately convinced, went to them: they carried them before the mayor,
and he committed them for a riot.
I hear the mayor was very rough with William Penn.^

at the Old Bailey in [.book-title]#William Penn`'s Works,#

Thomas Beedle was committed from Horsleydown meeting for speaking.
Many of the professors`' meetings were broken up, and some committed;
but they skulk very much up and down in holes and corners, and when they are discovered,
fly away.

I have not much to add for you, but that we are all well;
and remember our dear love to my mother, yourself, our sisters, our little ones,
and the rest.

Dear Margaret Fox,

My dear love in the everlasting Truth is unto you and to all your family:
my soul is bound up with you in the covenant of love and life;
and I hope I shall never give you occasion to forget me,
but that I may be still in your remembrance when you call upon the Lord:
for my trials and exercises are many; and my bodily weakness is a great exercise to me;
but I have left off all my employment in printing books, by reason of my weakness.

Dear Margaret, all my care is,
that I may lay my head down in peace and rest with the Lord Jesus,
whom I have loved from a child, and in whom my trust is forevermore;
who has still supported me in all my trials, troubles, and exercises,
that I have met with,--blessed be the Lord! who is a present
help to all that trust in Him in the time of their need.

Here is a ship lately arrived from Barbados;
and I suppose you will receive some account from some others concerning your dear husband,^

I saw a letter from John Hull,

It seems the Council there have been very busy, in endeavouring to make an act,
in imitation of the act here, against conventicles;
but they find some opposition against it, so that, it may be, it may come to little.
There is great pressing of seamen, and beating up for volunteers to send to France;
so that it is like to be a dismal summer.
Here are two ambassadors from Holland, and very fair offers, as I hear,
for an accommodation, and from Spain likewise;
which makes a rumour as if our King would stand neuter,
and not assist either France or Holland; but this is much doubted by many.

Things are pretty well and quiet here, in relation to Friends and Truth;
only we are kept out of our meetings at Ratcliff and Wheeler Street still,
but not by soldiers; and sometimes we are let in, when the constable is moderate.
Things are pretty quiet generally in the counties also;
and the good seed grows up and increases,
in the midst of the troubles that are in the world.

There is like to be war again, some talk, between Holland and England;
but France and Holland go certainly to war.
There has been a great deal of hurt done by the last great storm;
above an 100 sail cast away: Samuel Ellis is judged to be lost,
also two more Friends`' vessels, men and all.
William Baily and J. Tiplady were in the storm, but were preserved:
it has broken down the banks in Lincolnshire, and drowned the country for twelve miles,
and carried away their corn and cattle and goods, and some were drowned:
the like storm has not been heard of for many years.
This is the most from your loving friend.

=== On the King`'s Declaration for the Release of Friends out of the Prisons in 1672

+++[+++George Whitehead, in his [.book-title]#Christian Progress,# states,
"`There was but little respite from persecution in twelve years time,
from the year 1660 unto 1672,
in which was the last war at sea between the English and Dutch;
so that one judgment and calamity followed another, plague, fire, and war,
unto great depopulation and devastation;
showing God`'s heavy displeasure against persecution and cruelty,
and that spirit which had been so highly at work, against innocent, conscientious,
and honest people,
(some of whom the Lord delivered by death;) yet many persecutors were so hardened,
that they repented not of their cruelties; and we have observed in our times,
how suddenly the Lord swept away many of that sort.
Howbeit by this time +++[+++A. D. 1671-2,]
the King did seem to bethink himself to take other measures,
than to continue persecution to destroy his own subjects,
not knowing what issue the Dutch war against him might come to;
insomuch that he published a declaration of indulgence to Dissenters,
to suspend the execution of penal laws in matters ecclesiastical.`"

The King, by this declaration,
suspended the execution of all penal statutes against all sorts of non-conformists immediately;
and all judges and justices, etc., were to take notice of the same,
and pay due obedience thereto.
Soon after the said declaration of indulgence was published,
George Whitehead addressed the King on behalf of his suffering friends in prison,
to the number of 400 or upwards;
some of whom had endured ten or eleven years`' imprisonment.
After further exertions, he and his friend Thomas Moore,
(for whom the King had some respect,) were permitted to appear at the Council,
to be heard on the case.
George Whitehead proceeds:--

"`Then Thomas Moore, myself, and our friend Thomas Green,
attended at the Council Chamber, Whitehall;
and were all admitted in before the king and a full Council.
Being called to go up before the King, who was at the upper end of the Council board,
I had a fair opportunity to open the case of our
suffering Friends as a conscientious people,
chiefly to show the reason of our not swearing allegiance
to the King;--that it was not in any contempt,
or disrespect, either to the King`'s person or government; but singly,
as it is a matter of conscience to us not to swear at all, nor in any case, and that,
in sincere obedience to Christ`'s command and gospel ministry;
(Matt. 5 and James 5.) When I had opened,
and more fully pleaded our suffering Friends`' case, the King gave this answer:
'`I`'ll pardon them,`' etc.
Whereupon Thomas Moore pleaded the innocency of our Friends, that they needed no pardon,
being innocent, etc., the King`'s own warrant in a few lines would discharge them:
'`for where the word of a King is, there is power;`' said Thomas Moor.
The King answered, '`Oh!
Mr. Moore, there are persons as innocent as a child (or children) new born,
that are pardoned, that is, from the penalties of the law;
you need not scruple pardon,`' etc.
After which George Whitehead made this answer: '`It is not for us to prescribe,
or dictate to the King and his Council what methods to take for our Friends`' discharge;
they know best their own methods in point of law; we seek the end thereof, namely,
the effectual discharge of our suffering Friends out of prison;
that they may live peaceably, and quietly enjoy their own,
etc.`' Whereupon they all appeared satisfied.`"--[.book-title]#Christian Progress.#

After the occurrence of these proceedings,
circular letters were addressed to the sheriffs of the counties,
requiring them to make return to the Council board,
lists of our Friends confined in their respective jails.
A copy of the circular, sent down to Friends in the counties, is here given.]

[.letter-heading]

After our hearty commendations--Whereas request has been made unto his Majesty,

that his Majesty would be pleased to extend his mercy towards them,

accordingly we do hereby will and require you to
procure a perfect list or calendar of the names,
times, and causes of commitment of all such persons called Quakers,

Dear Stephen Crisp,

Before your letter came to my hand,
I had drawn up a paper containing the substance of yours,
which (before I had yours) Thomas Moore had given to the King,
together with a list of the premunired Friends, and of those sentenced for banishment,
etc.; which hitherto has been effectual, in order to a further inquiry about Friends, etc.
How far the King and Council have proceeded, in answer to the request,
I leave it to William Crouch to inform you.
Your paper is kept for a further occasion, if need be, if our end be not answered by them.
But we are encouraged to hope well for various reasons.
I could not well send to write to you before, being much exercised for the sufferers.
The Council yesterday signed the letters to the sheriffs for a return of Friends`' commitments,
etc., to the Board;
so that they are like to be had with expedition into the several counties.

My very dear love to you, your wife, R. Crouch, and Friends.

Dear Mother,

Last sixth-day the two women took the grant out of the Attorney General`'s office,
and he gave them his fee, which should have been £5; his clerk took but 20s,
whereas his fee was 40s. Yesterday they went with it to the King,
who signed it in the Council; and Arlington also signed it, but would take no fees,
whereas his fees would have been £12 or £20;
neither would Williamson`'s man take anything,--saying, that if any religion were true,
it was ours.
Tomorrow it is to pass the signet, and on sixth-day the privy seal,
and afterwards the broad seal, which maybe done on any day.
The power of the Lord has wrought mightily in the accomplishment of it;
and the Lord has bowed their hearts wonderfully in it,--blessed be his name forever!

Dear Margaret Fox,

My dear love in the pure Truth, in which is my stay and trust in all exercises,
and over all fading things whatsoever.
Oh! the Lord keep me in his power, that I may answer his requirings at all times.

I received your letter, dated the first of this month, wherein I was much refreshed.
The weakness of my body is such, that it makes the exercises I meet with much more hard;
so that I am often ready to fall under, by reason thereof.
George Whitehead and myself have been much employed
this summer in the business of the prisoners`' liberty;
and it is such a troublesome business to go through, as I have not met with the like:
it lies now in the Secretary`'s hands, ready signed by the King, and lacks only dating:
I have engrossed it once already,
and it contains six of the largest skins of parchment I could get;
and I must engross it once more for the Signet Office;
and from there it is to go to the Crown Office, or Patent Office,
and to be engrossed in Chancery hand, when I suppose it will make at least twelve skins.
If we could once get it passed the Signet and Privy Seal, I hope it would soon be done;
in the mean time, we must attend in patience.

Our meetings here and in most or all parts are very quiet, so far as I know.
I have not much more to acquaint you of.
My dear love is to your daughters and to all Friends.

Dear Margaret Fox,

My dear love in the precious Truth is unto you and to all your family.
This is chiefly to acquaint you, that now our business,
which George Whitehead and myself have taken so much pains and care about this summer,
is accomplished, and under the great seal,
and two duplicates of the same under the great seal also;
the original contains eleven skins of parchment.
There were about 500 persons contained in it:
how we shall dispense it to the several counties, as yet we are not fully resolved;
but expect that a letter from the King`'s principal Secretary to the respective sheriffs,
signifying the pardon, may be effectual to discharge them;
but of this you may hear more in the next.^

completion of this business of the King`'s pardon,

The original patent deed is preserved, with the other records of the Society,
in London:--a copy of it is given in the appendix to George Whitehead`'s [.book-title]#Christian Progress.#
{footnote-paragraph-split}
Among
the names of prisoners discharged by this patent,
is included the noted John Bunyan from the prison at Bedford.
It has been matter of some surprise to the editor, to discover recently,
through a public channel,
how little this circumstance respecting John Bunyan
being discharged with Friends in 1672,
appears to be known in the dissenting community.
In [.book-title]#John Bunyan`'s Life,# it is stated, "`In 1672,
Mr. Bunyan was discharged from imprisonment; +++[+++from Bedford Jail,
after having been confined there twelve years.+++]+++
This event is generally ascribed to Dr. Barlow,
Bishop of Lincoln.`"
{footnote-paragraph-split}
The author of this Life (published by the Religious Tract Society,
and compiled from Scot, Burder, and Ivimey,) then enters into particulars,
in what way assistance was supposed to have been afforded in this instance;
but no allusion is made to Friends,
or to the instrument under which his discharge was actually
effected.
{footnote-paragraph-split}
George Whitehead, in his [.book-title]#Christian Progress,#
explains the circumstance:--"`When the instrument for the
discharge of the prisoners was granted to our Friends,
there being other dissenters besides Quakers, in some prisons, as Baptists,
Presbyterians, and Independents, some of their solicitors,
seeing what way we had made with the King for our Friends`' release,
desired that their friends in prison might be discharged with ours,
and have their names in the same instrument,
and earnestly requested my advice or assistance;
which I was very willing to give in compassion to them.
Accordingly I advised them to petition the King (with the names of the prisoners
in it,) for his warrant to have them inserted in the same patent with the Quakers;
which accordingly they did petition for and obtain.
So that there are a few names of other dissenters, who were prisoners in Bedfordshire,
Kent and Wiltshire, (as I remember,) in the same instrument with our Friends,
and released thereby; which I was very glad of,
that they partook of the same benefit through our industry:
for when we had made way and beaten the path, it was easy for them to follow.
And indeed I was never backward to give any of them advice (if I could) for their help,
when any of them have been in straits, and come to me for advice or help.
Our being of different judgments and societies, did not abate my compassion or charity,
even towards them, who had been my opposers in some cases: Blessed be the Lord my God,
who is the Father and Fountain of mercies, whose love and mercies in Christ Jesus to us,
should oblige us to be merciful and kind one to another; we being required to love mercy,
(yes, to be merciful, as well as to do justly,) and to walk humbly with our God.`"]

I suppose you heard that the Parliament is prorogued.
Things are very quiet here, and a great openness there is in the nation,
blessed be the Lord; who is establishing his Truth in the earth,
and makes use of weak and contemned instruments in his hand,
to confound the great and mighty things of the world.
I hear that John Stubbs and Solomon Eccles are prisoners in Boston, New England.
Friends here did at the Quarterly Meeting take into consideration
my pains and care in the service of Truth,
and are willing to allow me a man to assist,
which is some encouragement to me;--and I hope, through the Lord`'s assistance,
to perform my office in faithfulness to the end.
So this is the most at present.

Dear Margaret Fox,

My dear love is unto you: I received your letter,
and am always glad to hear from you and of your welfare;
and am glad to hear you are well returned to your home.
We have had no letters lately from your dear husband,^
footnote:[Then in the West Indies.]
nor from any with him: the last was sent from John Stubbs out of New England:
I suppose he is now in Virginia or Maryland.
As concerning the business of Friends`' liberty, it is fully executed in all counties,
except Durham, Cumberland, Lancashire, and Monmouth in Wales, which are still to do;
all the rest of the counties are discharged.
For Cumberland I sent down a liberate to the sheriff about three weeks since;
but it seems by a letter I received from Thomas Stordy,
the sheriff was discharged his office the day before;
so this night by the post I dispatched another liberate to the new Sheriff,
which I hope will do effectually.
For Durham we have waited till Gilbert Gerrard came, who came last fourth-day;
and I expect a liberate to discharge those Friends in a few days.
In Lancaster there are but two Friends in that jail inserted in the patent:
George Whitehead and I have been many times to seek the sheriff of that county,
but cannot meet with him; but his deputy says, that it is a county palatinate,
and he has no power over the prisoners, but the jailer has it by patent;
so I think we must be forced to send down one of the patents which must be showed to him,
by the first opportunity we can.

I have been concerned this week or two with the Council,
concerning Thomas Hutson and James Strutt, whose ships, and two more,
are stopped by order of the Duke +++[+++of York (?)]; for they have made an order in Council,
that from that day forward not any vessel, little or great,
shall go to sea out of any port in England, without guns; great guns, if great ships,
and small guns and grenades, if small ships; and must give bond to fight, if occasion be.
This order is procured by the envious petition of some Barbados merchant in this city;
which will tend to the great damage of many Friends,
whose whole maintenance depends upon the sea trade.

[.salutation]
Dear Margaret Fox,

My dear love is unto you, and to all your children.
I received your letter, and I am glad to hear of your safe arrival at your home.
And as concerning your husband, and Thomas Lower,^
footnote:[Imprisoned in Worcester Jail.]
George Whitehead, Thomas Moore and myself have been much concerned about it:
Thomas Moore read your paper to the king in his chamber,
and had an hour`'s time with him.
It will be too large to relate all that passed between them: only thus,
he was very kind to Thomas,
and told him he was not willing to do any such thing of himself;
but wished him to come to the Council,
(which was last sixth-day was a week;) where we attended,
and the paper was read in the Council, and the matter debated.

And Thomas spoke to the King after the Council;
and he told him the result of the Council,
which was to this effect,--that there being no law broken by them, he could do nothing;
but they were left to the law to right them: so no relief we could have in the case then.
The King is very timorous (it being just at the pinch of the Parliament`'s
coming on,) of doing anything to displease them,
his occasions being so great for money, which might somewhat impede the business.
This day a week ago we sent down a letter from William Penn`'s mother to the Lord Windsor,
who is Lord Lieutenant for the County,^
footnote:[Worcestershire.]
which is received, as we do understand by George Fox.

We hope that the Lord Lieutenant will be wrought upon by the letter of L. Penn,
who is well acquainted with him;
that the old snare of the oath may be waived at the Sessions.--George
Whitehead and myself have not been deficient in turning every stone
that might be advantageous for obtaining their liberty,
nor yet shall we desist in the matter;
but I fear there is nothing can be done till the term;
except they should premunire at the Sessions,
and then we must apply ourselves again to the King.^
footnote:[Refers to the commitment of George Fox and Thomas Lower to Worcester Jail,
as narrated at large in [.book-title]#George Fox`'s Journal,# under date, 1673-4.]
I was this day at the Lord Treasurer`'s,
and I have a grant to have orders for each County,
to remit the King`'s part of the fines (levied by force
of the last act) +++[+++in the case of the released Friends (?)]
If Friends in Lancashire will have one, send me word,
they will cost about forty shillings a piece.

The House of Commons sat last fourth-day, and the King was there,
and made a speech to them; and the keeper +++[+++Lord Keeper (?)]
made an eloquent one,
pressed them earnestly for a speedy supply of money to carry on the war,
showing the danger if delayed,
and of the ill consequence the disaffection of his people would be to him in this juncture,
and that he had never more need of their concurrence;
and that whatever was lacking to secure religion or property more than what he had done,
let them propose what reasonably they would, and he was ready to receive it.

So, dear Margaret, I have given you an account of things as they stand at present,
and in that true and sincere love, which was always in my heart to you, I remain,

Dear Margaret Fox,

Our dear love in the truth and sincerity of our hearts, salutes you and your family,
Ellis Hookes having given you an account before,
of our endeavours and labours for your husband`'s liberty before the Sessions,
it is our business now to mention what has passed since.
At Sessions they tendered him the oath, through the instigation of Parker,^
footnote:[The Justice who was so severe against them, and who committed them.]
after some discourse, and fair carriage from the Justices;
but they released Thomas Lower, pretending that he had good friends as before:
we suspected that Doctor Lower`'s^
footnote:[George Fox states that Dr. Lower was one of the King`'s physicians.]
soliciting only on his brother`'s behalf,
and procuring a letter to the Lord Lieutenant only for him,
might be some impediment to George`'s liberty.
But now at the beginning of the term, we have procured _Habeas Corpus,_
and sent down to Worcester last seventh-day,
to remove George and his cause to the King`'s Bench, within ten days`' time;
since which we could not as yet hear,
but expect shortly to hear whether the Sheriff allows of it; if not,
we think to proceed on for another.

We have done in this, according to George Fox`'s desire; not doubting if he comes up,
his bonds will be easier here;
for in all likelihood they intend to run him to a
premunire at the court session at Worcester.

We are in haste; so with our love to all your children and Friends that way.

given to the King and Council, and both the Houses of Parliament;
and they do generally acknowledge the reason of the thing:
and Friends did attend the Parliament; and they were so taken with the thing,
that they had intended to have done something, had they sat longer.
And Friends gave some of them to the Mayor and Aldermen and Common Council;

and did generally confess the reason of the thing.

for Friends to take the substance, and give to their parliaments,
assemblies and governors: and they sing them about the streets:
and I desire that you at your monthly and quarterly meetings would send for some of them,
and give them at the court session to all the justices, and them that be in power,
and bailiffs, or mayors; for they do give a great light to dark people:
and it was given to the judges and the men of the jury;
and Friends have distributed many of them to under officers.

That which S. +++[+++Sarah (?)]
writes, of some of them +++[+++the family (?)]
coming up to me, I can say little how I may be ordered;
for they moved the Court to have me down to Worcester,
and have got a _habeas corpus_ and a warrant for the same purpose;
and a great jumble and work there has been about it: but the Truth is over all,
and I am in the Lord`'s hands.
The King can do nothing, it being in the judges`' and the sheriffs`' hands;
so they do suppose that I must go to Worcester court sessions.

The salmon you speak of, is not yet come, neither do they know by what carrier;
nor where he inns.
I had written to you before, but there has been a great jumble +++[+++?]
about me, and is still: but the Lord is at work among them, and it will be well;
blessed be the Lord.^

Dear Margaret Fox,

My dear and tender love is unto you in the Truth, which is pure forever.
Blessed be the Lord, whose mercies endure forever,
and who has always had regard to his tender seed;
which the enemy has always sought to root out,
and to hinder the growth of inwardly and outwardly:
but the Lord has been the stay and strength of his in all their exercises.

I suppose you will hear by other hands that your dear husband
is discharged of his imprisonment at the Sessions;^

so that his life was despaired of.
His wife, however, interceded with the King for his release,

He was then a second time brought up to the King`'s Bench bar on _habeas corpus,_

[.salutation]
Dear George Fox,

My fervent upright love salutes you.
Yours per post and by E. M., I have.
For your business it becomes me not to say what I have endeavoured;
but I have with much diligence attempted to get all done as I should desire:,
I am yet resolved to make one push more about it;
so that I cannot write a positive and conclusive account till next seventh or second-day;
by which time I hope to have an answer of this great man: his uncle lately died,
and left him £3000 per annum, and he just married, which did divert the matter.
I wrote concerning the writ of error, that it must be received in open session,
and the record of the judgment certified by the clerk to the judges of the King`'s Bench;
and if then it appear that there is error, to bear a _habeas corpus,_ you shall have one.
The King knows not that you refuse a pardon,
only that we choose rather a more clear and suitable way to your innocency: I am,
and _in stay,_ in town, to do my utmost.
The Lord God knows I would come in your place to release you;
but the Lord`'s will be done.^
footnote:[From an original letter of William Penn to George Fox,
(which came to hand while this sheet was in type,) "`dated 20th of 9th month +++[+++11th month]

did as good as put himself in a loving way to get your liberty.
He prevailed with the King for a pardon; but that we rejected:
then he pressed for a more noble release, that better answered Truth; he prevailed,
and got the King`'s hand to a release: it sticks with the Keeper +++[+++Lord Keeper;
Sir Heneage Finch, who was sometimes rather stiff with his Royal Master]
and we have and do use what interest we can.
The King is angry with him; and promised very largely and lovingly:
so that if we have been deceived, you see the grounds of it.
Things are brave as to Truth in these parts,--and great conviction upon people.`"]

Dear George, things are pretty quiet, and meetings very full, and precious, and living;
blessed be the Lord God forever!
As for the sufferings I have spoken to George Whitehead;
they say there is not stock for such a work;
that they have neither press nor materials for such a considerable work;
and that £1500 will scarcely do it.
The name of the everlasting Lord God be blessed and praised,
for His goodness and mercies, forever, says my soul:--He is our blessed rock,--the life,
joy, and length of our days,--the blessed portion of them that believe and obey.

My unchangeable love flows to you, dear George, and in it I salute you, your dear wife,

London, 27th of 10th month +++[+++12 month]

[.salutation]
Dear George Fox,

My very dear and sincere love in Christ Jesus, is hereby manifested to you;
even that pure unchangeable love,
which the God of my life did shed abroad in my heart in the dawning of his blessed day;
and which lives in my heart, and flows to you: in which I dearly salute you,
and Margaret Fox with Thomas and Mary Lower, Isabel, Sarah, Susan and Rachel Fell,
with all in that family, whose hearts are sincere and upright to God.

Dear George, by this you may know that Friends here are generally well,
and our meetings are very full and peaceable;
and the power and presence of the Lord is in the midst of our assemblies.
We have of late been exercised with Pennyman, Boyce, and Chadwel +++[+++opponents:]
but the power of the Lord is over them, and of late we have been quiet.
Yesterday, Boyce and Chadwel were at Gracechurch street meeting;
but there was very little disturbance, and the meeting ended in peace;
and all the rest throughout the city were peaceable.
That which at present is weighty upon our spirits is,
the division between the two Johns +++[+++John Wilkinson and John Story,]
and Friends of the North; and though there has been much writing to and fro,
and endeavours used, yet little is yet brought forth to put an end to these sad rents.^
footnote:[See [.book-title]#John Burnyeat`'s Journal (Select Series)# p. 223, 226,
respecting these Separatists.]

It has been some time in my mind to write to you,
concerning the choice of the six Friends to go down into the North,
to have a rehearsing of matters and things now in difference;
of which number I am chosen one,
whom the Friends in the Second-day`'s meeting did nominate:
though I was not present at the beginning of the meeting,
for I came that morning from Rickmansworth.
When I understood how things had been in the meeting that day, and that I was chosen,
etc. the thing fell as a weight upon me; and I told Friends my mind,
that I could not then consent, and desired time to weigh the thing.
And truly, George, to this very day I have a straitness in my mind,
seeing very little likelihood of a reconciliation;
for the former judges I understand are satisfied in their judgment,
and are resolved to stand by it, as some have said.
Now if we should come and join with them,
and if it should so fall out that they and we should differ in some things,
my fear and godly jealousy is, that instead of making up breaches,
more may be made;--for which God knows I would not be an instrument;
for I have loved peace from my youth, and hated strife.

In the first appearance and work of God in our souls,
there was a reconciliation to God in our souls and spirits,
before we were reconciled and cemented in heart and mind one to another.
Also something is further to be minded, whether in this juncture of time,
such a meeting can be borne in the country, without disturbance;
for it will be hard to have such a meeting so private, (Friends coming from here,
and from Bristol,) but it will be taken notice of.
These with other things are straits and difficulties in my way; though I stand resigned,
and could be willing to travel hundreds of miles
to be serviceable for the good and peace of the church.

Dear George, I desire to have a few words from you: I shall not add further at present,
but leave all things to the Lord, desiring to be guided by His wisdom in all things;
that so long as I have a being in this world, I may live to his glory,
who gives me life and being.

I rest your brother in my measure of grace received from God.

Dear Friends,

As we ought not to be discouraged in our endeavours for
the relief of the oppressed by any present disappointments,
so we desire that all Friends who are in capacity,
(as they have freedom and clearness,) may appear and make what good interest they can,
in this election of Parliament men, for sober, discreet and moderate men:
such as live in love with their neighbours, that are against persecution and popery,
and that deport themselves tenderly towards our Friends.
Be very cautious of giving any just occasion of offence.
We desire God`'s wisdom may be with you,
in the discharge of your duty and conscience in these things.

And whereas this vote was passed by this Parliament, the day they last prorogued, namely,

"`Lunæ, 10-mâ. die, January, 1680.

My dear Friends and well-beloved brethren,
with whom my life is bound up in the covenant of God`'s gracious, glorious light,
wherein consists our life and peace:
as we keep our habitations and dwelling places therein,
we shall be preserved near unto the ocean of all love and life,
and know the fountain unsealed,
and the springings of it to bubble up in our own particular bosoms:
wherein we may drink together into the one Spirit, by which we are sealed,
in the enjoyment of the heavenly power that sanctifies;
in the living sense and consolidating virtue of which, according to measure,
I do dearly value you all.^
footnote:[Some disadvantage is felt, as regards the copy of this epistle,
in not having had the original to transcribe from.]

Well, dear Friends, before this comes to your hands,
I conclude you have an account of the departure of our ancient
Friend and honourable elder in the church of God,
George Fox; who was this day buried,
in the presence of a large and living assembly of God`'s people,
who did accompany him to the ground, and was supposed to be above 4000 Friends.
The meetinghouse at Gracechurch-street could not contain them,
nor the court before the door,--many could not get to within hearing of the testimonies.
Many living, open, powerful testimonies were published in the meetinghouse,
and many in the graveyard, among many tender hearts, watery eyes, and contrite spirits.

The London Friends were very discreet,
to order all passages and concerns relating thereto with great wisdom every way:
there being six monthly meetings belonging to this city,
six chosen Friends were nominated and appointed out of every monthly meeting,
who were to carry the corpse, and none else;
and that his relations should all go next the corpse;
that all Friends should go on one side of the street, three and three in a rank,
as close together as they could go,--that the other
side might be left clear for the citizens and coaches,
that were going about their business.
The graveyard is a large plot of ground, yet it was quite full,
and some of the people of the world were there.

The last week George Fox was at the Quarterly meeting, the Second-day morning meeting,
the Meeting for Sufferings, and at two meetings for worship;
besides the first-day morning meeting, which was at Gracechurch-street meetinghouse.
On the seventh-day, he came to lodge at Henry Gouldney`'s, +++[+++in White Hart Court,]
to be near on the first-day where he kept the meeting;
and said he was as well that meeting as he had been a long time before:
yet he began to be ill in the evening, about the fifth hour that first-day;
and departed before the tenth hour in the evening of the third-day following.
I was with him most of the time; wherein he spoke many living powerful sentences,
to the tendering of the company present.
There was no sign of any great pain upon him, neither did he ever complain.

Robert Widders`' manner of departure and his were much alike, for I saw them both;
only George shut up his eyes himself, and his chin never fell, nor needed any binding up,
but lay as if he had been fallen asleep,--one would have thought he had smiled:
he was the most pleasant corpse that I ever looked upon,
and many hundreds of Friends came to see his face,
having the most part of three days`' time to behold him, before the coffin was nailed up.
Friends carried the coffin on their shoulders, without any bier, cloth, or cover,
but the natural wood; yet the coffin was very smooth and comely.

Well Friends, about two hours or less before he died, he took me by the hand,
and bid me remember his love to Friends where I travelled.
I intended to go out of the city on the morrow after he began to be sick;
but seeing him ill, it was Friends`' mind I should stay,
and see how it might be with him; and I had more freedom to stay than to go:
and I was glad to see such a heavenly and harmonious conclusion as dear George Fox made;
the sense and sweetness of it, will, I believe, never depart from me:
in the heavenly virtue of which, I desire to rest; and remain your brother.

there he underwent very grievous sufferings,

Giving an Account of the Decease of George Fox

[.signed-section-context-open]
London, 15th of 11th month, 1690, +++[+++1st month 1691.]

[.salutation]
Loving Friend John Airey,

This comes to acquaint you, that that ancient, honourable, and worthy man, George Fox,
is departed this life.
He was at Gracechurch-street meeting on first-day last,
and gave in his testimony among others: after meeting he fell into cold shivering fits,
and grew worse and worse, and weaker, until third-day last at night,
between nine and ten, he died.
In his weakness he desired to be remembered to all Friends,
and advised and admonished Friends to fly to the power of God:
he died sweetly and quietly, and was sensible to the last.
After the meeting on fourth-day at Gracechurch-street,
all or most of the Friends of the ministry there, went into a chamber hard by;
as well to condole on the loss and death of that good man,
as also to take care about his burial, which is ordered from this meetinghouse tomorrow,
+++[+++sixth-day,]
about four in the afternoon.
In the chamber was William Penn, Stephen Crisp, George Whitehead, J. Taylor of York,
William Bingley, John Vaughton, Francis Stamper, John Field, Samuel Waldenfield,
John Boucher, and others; and only, as I remember, three of us not preachers.

While we sat together under the deep consideration of the loss of that good man,
the wonderful power of God fell upon all in the room;
insomuch that not one could contain themselves,
but was broken down by the weight of that glory;
so that for a considerable time there was nothing but deep sighs, groans, and tears.
And after that all had given vent to their feelings and grew quiet in their minds,
several of them, under that great sense, gave testimonies concerning him,
too large here to insert: One said, "`a valiant is fallen in Israel this day,
and his place there would be vacant,
if some faithful ones did not supply that glorious station he was in.`"
Another, "`that it was his faith, and that it was with him,
that that Spirit and power which had in so large a measure, dwelt in that body,
should extend itself into thousands.`"
Another repeated the antiquity of his standing, service, and faithfulness to the end.
Another, that he was as a fixed star in the firmament of God`'s glory,
and there he should shine forever.
I hope I shall never forget that day; the remembrance of it is sweet.
It is ordered that the elders and ancients of Friends take up the corpse first,
and six are chosen and matched out of each of the
six monthly meetings about London to carry,
of which I am one for our quarter, and J. Beliam.

Dear Friends,

Our dear love in the Lord Jesus Christ salutes you.
Being sensible of your suffering condition under that public calamity,^

we cannot but sympathize with you, and pray God to relieve and ease you;
your distressed condition being often in our remembrance before the Lord:
to whom we desire you may daily apply your hearts,
in fervent prayer with supplication for relief and support;
and He will be near to strengthen and comfort you, who is a God that hears prayer,
and a present help in times of need; and who will hear and answer the cries of his elect,
who cry unto him day and night; and in his own time will plead their cause,
and arise in their defence.

Dear Friends, hereby we give you to understand,
that the day after the date of this annexed epistle
to you from our dear brother George Fox,
being the 11th of this month,
he was enabled to preach the Truth in our public meeting in White Hart Court,
near Gratia`'s street (London;) and the same day
he was taken with some indisposition of body,
more than usual; and on the 13th of this month, being two days after,
a little after the ninth hour in the night, it pleased God to take him out of the body,
unto himself, whom he had so long faithfully served.
On the 16th of this month his body was buried from our meetinghouse,
in White Hart Court aforesaid;
being attended with a vast concourse of Friends and people:
and a very heavenly and blessed solemnity was held,
both at the meeting and burying ground.
His great love and care was for Friends and the spreading of Truth;
and he particularly mentioned you, the very day of his departure;
being sensible to the last, and ending his days in his faithful testimony,
as our God in his wisdom ordered.

Unto whose divine power and care we recommend you;
and in his tender love in Christ Jesus, we remain

[.salutation]
Dear Friend,

Yours of the 11th of this month, I received today;
and I desire you to acquaint the Friends,
that dear George Fox`'s [.book-title]#Journal# is (I hope) well near transcribed;
for though some years remain still to be digested, yet being the latter part of his time,
they will yield less matter than the former years have done.
I am now in the year 1684, and am just bringing him over out of Holland,
from his second and last voyage there.
I wish I could have dispatched it with more expedition; but can assure Friends and you,
I have not neglected it, nor been lazy at it.
I have much other public business lying upon me, and some private,
which may not be wholly neglected:
but the main of my time has been spent on this service.
As to hastening it to the press, Friends may do as they please;
but if I may take leave to offer my advice,
I think it were well that the whole were deliberately and carefully read over again,
before it be committed to the press; that nothing may be omitted fit to be inserted,
nor anything inserted fit to be left out.

I left above two hundred sheets with W. Mead last summer,
which I hope he has looked over since, at more leisure than we did then.
So that, if Friends be urgent to set the press to work,
I dare engage (if God be pleased to give me life
and health) it shall not be lacking a copy,
when they shall be wrought off: yet in a work of this kind,
I would choose rather to answer expectation in exactness than speed.
I am engaged (if the Lord permit) to attend the Yearly Meeting,
and hope I may by that time, give a more full account of what remains in my hands.
Meanwhile, in very hearty love to the Friends, with yourself and wife.

+++[+++Josiah Coale in his testimony concerning the author of the following letter,
writes:--"`although he +++[+++Richard Farnsworth]
was (before) a man of great abilities, and parts, and knowledge,
and accounted of among men, even excelling many of his equals;
yet he was content and willing, in obedience to the power of God,
to become a fool to the world,
and to be stripped and emptied of his own wisdom and knowledge,
and to suffer the loss of all worldly reputation and favour,
and the pleasures and delights thereof, that he might win Christ Jesus,
and be found his servant, clothed with the righteousness of faith.
His service was very great for the Lord in his day;
for he was so furnished with heavenly wisdom and understanding through the grace of God,
and so seasoned thereby, that his patience,
meekness and humility exceeded many.`"--Josiah Coale, [.book-title]#The Last Testimony,# etc. p. 5. 7.

Richard Farnsworth to Two Friends

[.signed-section-context-open]
1653.

[.salutation]
Dear Brethren,

My dear love to you both with the rest of our dear Friends that way: I am in good health,
praises be to the Lord for his everlasting mercies to me.

I have gone through much, since I was with you;
but I found the Lord exceedingly great towards me.
I was at Stanley on the first-day; the power of the Lord was much manifested,
very many were wrought on.
There was one of Marshall`'s^
footnote:[Marshall was the priest of Wakefield. [.book-title]#Sewel`'s History,# vol i. p. 66.]
hearers wrought on, and one of the Baptists, that day,
and Captain Siddall`'s wife with many others.
The next day we went about sixteen miles to Wakefield, and the people followed us much.
In the market place I was drawn forth to speak, and the people were very audible,
till a schoolmaster came and stirred them up.
Then as we were in the crowd, came Captain Siddall`'s wife;
and she was wrought on in the tumult,
and cried out,--"`This is the power of the Lord:`" she was very proud,
but now is humbled.
Doctor Hodgson was shaken a little, and he is very loving to us; we went into his house,
and there the people got in as many as could thrust.

I was drawn forth much to speak unto them; they wondered at the work of the Lord.
There was such confusion among the people, so that I was moved to stand upon the table,
and spoke with much power among them; they were all silent,
and were very attentive to hear me a long time;
neither did they speak anything unto me afterwards.
But at night when we came out of the town,
the devil did rage among them,--his kingdom being so struck at; so that they stoned us,
stones flew as fast as bullets in a battle; but the Lord did carry everyone above it,
that not so much as one received any harm, but all were made to rejoice.
But had not the Lord`'s power been much manifested,
none could have escaped with their lives; had not the Lord been on our side,
when the enemies rose up against us, we had been swallowed up quick.
But all were made mightily to rejoice; praise and honour be unto the Lord forever!

In the morning we went to York.
Friends at York are very well, all but Jane Holmes, she is somewhat weak in body.
Friends are close shut up in prison, and none of us might come at them.
There is one +++_______+++ Sikes at Knottingley, and two or three more in prison about tithes:
this Sikes is a great man, of £300 or £400 a year by relation;
he has proclaimed against tithes.
He is very loving to our Friends; he had us up into his chamber;
I was brought to speak much to him, and he did receive it very lovingly.
We went from there to Manton, and there are many dear hearts there:
Balby Friends were with me; we were two nights and a day there;
very many Friends came from other places,
and the power of the Lord was much with us there.

We came on to Selby, and stayed there till three o`'clock in the morning,
and came the first-day morning to Stanley; where there was a great meeting,
very many from Leeds, and some from Wakefield, who had not been with us before.
So I see the Lord glorifying himself every way to his own praise;
but the world is all on a fire.
I am much threatened of my life, but I fear not what man can do.
I hear that there are warrants out against me for blasphemy.
Ah! dear hearts, be valiant; the Lord rides on triumphantly; ever praised be his name!

All Friends hereaway are well, and desired to be remembered unto you,
with the rest of our Friends.
Thomas Killam and Mary Aldam, etc., etc., salute you in the Lord,
and the God of love and power be with you.^

Bristol, 1st of 9th month +++[+++11th month]
1654.

[.salutation]
Dearly beloved Sister and Mother to many, who shall bless you in the name of the Lord!

On the first-day after we came to this city +++[+++Bristol,]
we had a meeting in the castle of many hundreds;
and afterward we went out (to get from the multitude) to a captain`'s house,
about a mile from the city; but abundance followed us all along the city to that place,
so that the house was filled, and it continued late.
And every day of the week, either out of the city or in it, we had meetings.
On the last first-day we had a meeting at one Captain Bishop`'s +++[+++George Bishop (?)]
house in the city; a large house with large rooms, but all were too little;
so in the afternoon we went to a place called the Fort.
There were about 2000 people there, and many great men and women, and all silent;
but we could hardly reach them with words, the multitude was so great: yet all was still,
and we could not get from them;
so that we were forced to go to a captain`'s house
into a private chamber to hide ourselves.

All this sounded through the city, and the priests and magistrates were in an uproar,
because they sought something against us.
On the second-day of the week we came into the city, and went to a merchant`'s house:
immediately the Mayor and Alderman, and the Justices of the Peace,
and the Priests assembled together into their judgment hall;
and the magistrates sent a sergeant to desire us to come to the council;
and we went freely, also many captains and great men of the city.
We went into an inner room, and many great men, friends to us, went in;
but they permitted them not to stay.
Then we opened our mouths, and said, we were come there according to their desire:
and they questioned us if we knew who spoke to us;
we answered that we believed we were before the magistrates or rulers of the city.

And they were fired, that we bowed not, nor put off our hats; but we were bold,
and told them we did it not in contempt of authority, but for conscience`' sake.
They asked our names and country, and we declared unto them;
and we told them we had been in London about a quarter of a year.
They asked us, how we came to the city; and we answered them,
and told them the commands and motion of the Lord,--that
we had to bear witness to his name,
and to declare the gospel committed unto us.--And it was
asked us whether our call was mediate or immediate;
we answered, immediately; we denied all mediate calls, for they were carnal.
They said, if we had the same immediate call, declare it.
Then I declared what I had been, and what I was:--we declared where we had habitations,
and that at the command of God we left them: and we spoke about a quarter of an hour,
and they gave audience.
They asked if we accused all the ministers in England; we said no;
there were many ministers of Christ in England, and we had unity with them:
but all hirelings and such as sought for their gain from their quarter, we denied.
But they pleaded for hire; and said the light was natural, and that everyone had it not,
and the like; they also said, we dishonoured the gospel.

After much striving and contending, when they could not ensnare us,
they all cast their ears together, and said, we had tumultuous meetings;
to which one of their own number answered,
there were many godly honest people without tumult.
So they could get naught against us, and they commanded us to depart out of the town:
but we were bold, and said, we were free-born men,
and we knew no law we had transgressed,
and therefore we should not be at any man`'s will; but when He moved us that called us,
we should; and come in again as He moved.
So we passed away, and all the people were silent,
and the priests and magistrates were enraged.
We stayed till night, and then went out of the city;
and this day we were moved to come in again, and to walk in the streets.

Here is an honest people and a great harvest: it is likely that bonds will attend us;
but all is one, in the will of God we stand free out of all.
John Audland and John Camm we see not yet, but expect their coming.
Here is a thirsty land; and truly,
the sound of the gospel committed to us is gone through all the regions round about.
The living God of life preserve us in his eternal power and wisdom;
in the will of the Lord we stand, and none can take away our joy.

Salute us dearly to George Fox;
one hour with him would be a great joy to us.--We lack nothing without;
the Lord reward you (and you have your reward) for
your care and love over all the church of Christ.
Salute us in the Lord to all the saints everywhere;
and pray that the living God may be honoured, and his name exalted forevermore.
The God of life and power be with you, and keep you and all your dear family,
in his eternal love and power to himself.

[.salutation]
Dear Brother,

This is to let you know of my journey and service in Wales.
I came out of Cheshire about five weeks ago,
and I stayed two first-days in Radnorshire in the mountains,
where I had several meetings,
where many of the people called Baptists are convinced of the Truth.
There is a great convincement in that part; but the most are Welch,
and some cannot understand English.
There are three who have the Welch tongue, who are serviceable, and labour among them;
which three Friends came out of the north of Wales.
There is one who is a Justice of peace convinced,
and is very faithful and serviceable in his place; I was five nights in his house,
and had a great meeting at his house; he dwells in the mountains in Montgomeryshire.

After I had been two first-days in Radnorshire I passed into Monmouthshire,
to a town called Abergavenny,
where I got a meeting that evening in the inn where I lodged;
and the next day being the market day, I was moved to speak in the market.
I drew the people into a convenient place, and spoke a pretty good time to them;
it cast a sound through the town and country, for not any Friend had spoken there before.
The next day, I met with my wife and Alexander Birket,
at a place where they had a meeting.
Alexander Birket is in Monmouthshire: two Justices of peace are convinced there.
The last first-day, I had a meeting four miles from Chepstow,
and another on the third-day; and this day being the fourth-day,
I had a meeting six miles beyond Cardiff at the sea side.
Tomorrow I pass to a general meeting in Newport at a Justice`'s house.

Dear and precious brother in the eternal unchangeable truth of God,
I do in my measure dearly salute you.
You are blessed of the Lord, dear brother; your fatherly care over me do I own,
and your voice is a comfort to me.
I am kept and nourished in the midst of my enemies, glory be to God in the Highest,
who has counted me worthy to bear the bonds of the gospel.

Dear brother, glad am I to hear from you, and of my dear brother Thomas Stubbs with you,
whom I do love in the Lord,
and the rest of your fellow prisoners,--the Lord has set you as a father over them.
I know your burden is great, for the work lies upon you; but your joy is in your children.
Truly there is a great appearance in these parts, but there is much need for ministers,
since I was cast in bonds; but a pretty good liberty I had among them,
before they were permitted to lay hold on me.
And great was the work of the Lord, and mightily did it spread to my great comfort.

And now these bonds have been very serviceable, to the piercing of the hearts of many,
and the discovery of the spirits of my persecutors,
and to the confirming of those in the Truth that were convinced;--they
have laboured to make my bonds grievous,
but my strength the Philistines know not.
Friends are much barred from me, yet not all.
Our tender sister M. S. is here in bonds in the Town prison;
she was put in last evening for speaking to a priest:
she has been in twice before this within a week, but they had not power to keep her in.

So may the same power that keeps you, keep me; and let your prayers be for me.
I rest with you in the brotherly unity, your tender brother,

[.salutation]
Dear Sister,

I dearly salute you, and my love reaches to you, even in that where we meet,
and have sweet fellowship and unity.
The everlasting Truth of our God is much spread abroad in this shire,
and many have received our testimony with great gladness and joy:
at this our enemies are vexed, and are disquieted;
and they gather together to battle against the Lord and his people.
We are counted as sheep for the slaughter, even as the off-scouring of all things,
fools and madmen;
and are made a prey upon by this generation of evil doers.--Condemnation is prepared
for them,--who slight the offers and tenders of his love,--even of Him,
who would gather them, as the hen gathers her chickens; yet they will not.
What could He have done more, who has sent his servants, early and late warning them,
even beseeching them to be reconciled to God through his dear Son.
But none of the princes of this world know Him, neither will they hearken to Him;
and so He is even rejected, disallowed of men, but chosen of God, and to us precious,
yes even the chief cornerstone.

Dear sister, since our last writing to you, Ambrose^
footnote:[Ambrose Rigge, who in the account of his life states,
that "`a fellow traveller was prepared for me,
which was Thomas Robertson of Westmoreland;
who was made willing to leave his dear wife and tender babes,
to go with me into the Lord`'s harvest.`"]
and I have been for the most part asunder; we have passed through part of this county,
as we were moved.
At Hampton there are a captain and two lieutenants,--they received the Truth gladly,
and several others; and at Portsmouth there were several that owned us.
There is an honest people hereaways, and there is great need of labourers;
pray therefore, that the Lord of the harvest would send forth labourers;
for many are coming in, and the Truth is of good report in several places;
and the Lord will gather in a people, that was not a people.
Ambrose has been serviceable, he was at some steeple houses;
and I believe we shall meet together before it be long, and go towards George Fox.

So in that which never changes, do I remain your brother in the unity of the Spirit,

Chesterton, near Cambridge, 11th of 5th month, +++[+++7th month]
1659.

[.salutation]
Dear George Fox,

Dear brother, my dear and tender love in the Lord, does flow forth unto you,
as unto a dear and tender father in the effectual Truth; who are honourable,
and had in esteem by them that fear the Lord and keep his covenant;
wherein your integrity and diligence for the Lord and his seed, I am truly sensible of.

It was upon me to acquaint you with some proceedings relating to Truth,
chiefly about Cambridge, since I parted from you;
where I had two meetings these last two first-days,
besides other two we had the last week.
+++[+++?]
The first meeting I had there was very serviceable on the former first-day;
where there were pretty many sober people, and several were reached.
But towards the latter end of the first meeting,
there came in many rude scholars,--however, they had not power to hurt any as I know;
yet after we went out of the room they would scarcely go out,
but had a desire to make disorder.
Whereupon presently the mayor of the town came into our meeting room,
like a lion among the wolfish scholars,
whom they expected had come to have broken up our meeting.
But on the contrary, he chased out the scholars,
and threatened them with imprisonment for their rudeness;
and then the mayor went into the college, which is right over against our meeting place,
and he complained of the scholars to the master or proctors of the college;
and told the master, if they would not take a course with them,
to keep them in better order, (he told me this of himself, and others,
for I was with him and John Crook,) he must, or send them to prison.
So he stood over them, and said that he must protect our meetings and their meetings.
Whereupon the scholars and the masters are much troubled,
that the mayor should offer to protect our meetings;
and many of them have a great spite against him.

Yesterday, being the last first-day, we had, I think,
a more serviceable meeting in Cambridge, than any we have had there yet;
though towards the latter end, some of the scholars were rude, and made noises,
and would have pulled me down: one tore at me to have done it;
but there was a secret power over them, which they knew not.
And many sober people were smitten to see their filthiness,
when I let them see what such men as these were, that they make ministers of.
Here is much to thunder down in this Cambridge;
but there is much patience and wisdom to be exercised towards them.
I intend to be there the next first-day: if the knock be not followed now,
they will get advantage; for the Truth has already gotten a name in the town.
The power of the Lord is working over them, though they know it not;
and it is the power only, that must overcome them.

Since I came from there,
I have had a precious service in the edge of Essex and Hertfordshire.
I suppose you may before now have heard of my service with the priest at Rickland,
at the steeple-house, on the first-day next after I parted from you;
many of his hearers were much reached and overcome with the Truth that day.
In the time that the priest was preaching, I took down some of his doctrine;
after he had done his preaching, I laid open some of it before his hearers,
who were most of them quiet and willing to hear, except two or three professors,
and the priest`'s wife.
There was John Crook in Cambridge the last week, whose being there was of service:
the scholars and priests are exceedingly tormented and quashed,
when any such Friends come to minister against their deceits,
as they look upon to be learned.

George Fox +++[+++doubtless George Fox, Junior]
was here the last week, and had one meeting in Cambridge and went towards Essex.
William Allen was with me in Cambridge yesterday;
he had only leave of the jailer at Colchester,
to come a little time into Cambridgeshire and thereaway.
There are great stirrings after the Truth in many places thereaways and other places;
truly the harvest is great and the labourers are but few.
These things I was free to make you acquainted with, in sincere love.

Dear Sister, often are you in my remembrance,
in my labour and travail in the vineyard of the Lord;
which is grown sweet and pleasant to walk in, to the praise of God.
I received your lines in Hampshire, when I was in much weakness of body,
by which I was much strengthened and refreshed; and truly, dear sister,
I hope in the Lord, through his strength, we shall be clear of all:
but our trials are many, especially among false brethren,
which as for the particulars at present, I shall not commit to paper.
Oh! dear sister, if it were not the living power of God,
it could never abide all the blows that come against it: but in all this we faint not,
but can truly say, our strength is renewed every morning,--glory to God on high!

Here is but one faithful brother with me, in all these south coasts on this side London;
nevertheless the Lord makes us able to water many tender plants.
The Truth does much prosper, and an addition daily here is, to the praise of God.
We shall give up to spend and be spent for the precious Truth,
which is more to me than all the world`'s glory.
I have been very weak in body of late,
but the Lord has raised me up again to labour in his harvest.

My love is dear to you, beyond what can be committed to paper, for the Truth`'s sake,
and your care over the flock of God; for which God will reward you.

Dear Margaret,

In Him, who is become a place of broad rivers and streams unto us,
and the portion of our cup, and the lot of our inheritance,--do I most dearly salute you.
The former days are not forgotten by me, nor the years past,
when we were all made to drink of one cup,
and were baptised into the death and suffering of Christ:
and were made to drink it willingly,
knowing it was our portion allotted unto us of the Lord, which we could not pass,
but must drink thereof.
And though it was irksome and grievous unto us, when our strength was but small; yet God,
out of his infinite love and mercy, strengthened us to bear, and to suffer,
and to deny that which hid immortality and life from us.
And He bore us up in his arms,
and made us to endure with patience the sufferings and the death;
that so we might obtain the resurrection of the dead: which indeed was a blessed time;
though for a moment it seemed grievous.

But now, having obtained the resurrection of the dead,
being baptised into the resurrection and into the life, more blessedness is known,
even spiritual blessings,
which God has given us to enjoy in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:
that like as we suffered one for another and one with another,
so we might be made to rejoice one with another and for another, and in Him alone:
in whom all our fresh springs are,
and from whom our joy and gladness and consolation spring.
He has opened the springs of the great deep, and has made life spring up,
whereby his little ones are refreshed, and the young men strengthened,
and the ancient and honourable confirmed and established.--Holy
and reverend be His name forevermore,
who is exalting his glorious mountain above the top of all the earth;
and making Jerusalem the praise and glory and admiration of the whole earth.

And let me tell you,
I am no more weary than the first day the sickle was put into the harvest;
when we went out sowing the seed weeping and in tears: but seeing sheaves brought home,
and full loads into the barn, and full draughts caught in the net,
it has made me look beyond fainting,--blessed be
the Lord!--I am glad you stay so long in that city,
+++[+++London,]
in which we have had many a burden and weary day:
but that fruit is brought forth unto God, plenteously countervails all,
and makes me forget travail.
I have been northward in Northumberland, Bishopric, and upon the east sea,
and back to York: truly the garden for the most part is very pleasant,
and gives a goodly smell, now when the south wind blows upon it.

and so be all satisfied in the will of the Lord God.
I hope in the Lord that you are all together, before this comes to you.
Be all satisfied and content with the will of the Lord;
and let neither murmuring nor repining enter any of your minds;
and let not sorrow fill your hearts,
for we have all cause to rejoice in the Lord evermore, and I most of all.^

The Darkhouse in Launceston, 12th of 11th month, 1664, +++[+++1st month 1665.]

[.salutation]
Dear George,

I hereby give you to understand that I am every way well,
in the work and service of the Lord; which does prosper,
and the Truth does gain ground daily, and flourishes in these parts;
many have desires after it, and adhere to it.
In this county of Cornwall, I have had fine service for the Lord;
as also all the way down from London, by way of Portsmouth, Southampton, and Weymouth,
and so down by the south sea.
I know not that I left one meeting unvisited, between London and the Lands-end,
but had every day a meeting or two for several weeks together,
to the refreshing of Friends;
and great comfort and satisfaction I have had in my journey hitherto.
I was upon leaving this county, being returned as far as Lanston,
where I had a small company together on the second-day last;
at which time the Mayor of the town, with his officers and others, came in,
and took us prisoners; and that night committed us to the town prison,
called "`the Darkhouse.`"

On the morrow, they called me alone to the Town-hall,
before the Mayor and the rest of the magistrates; and examined me of my place of abode,
and of my business here: to which I gave them answer accordingly;
and told them my business here was to visit my friends, etc.
They told me I was a very dangerous person, and suspicious;
and caused my pockets to be searched in the open court,
and found in it a paper that was written by you,
"`To the Ministers and Prophets,`" etc. about which they made a great stir,
asking me if I knew you, etc.
After above an hour`'s discourse they set me by, and called Benjamin Lawrence,
who travels with me for company, and examined him in like manner;
and then called the rest of Friends,
and committed them for refusing to pay 40s. a-piece fine,
till they shall be delivered by due course of law.
They told Benjamin and me,
that they proceeded against us by the law made against Quakers;
and fined us £5 a-piece for being at meeting.

They intended to have taken away our horses for the fine,
and to send us away with a pass; which when Friends understood,
they conveyed our horses out of the town, while I was before the magistrates.
When they saw our horses were gone, their rage was so kindled against us, that is,
Benjamin and me, that they sent us away alone to the Darkhouse without any court order;
and gave strict charge that none must come at us, but only to bring in our food,
and the keeper must hear what we say, and see that we do not write,
(though way is made for this,
contrary to their knowledge.) The prison we are consigned
to does not afford us the benefit of a chimney,
nor other necessary convenience.
But the power of the Lord God Almighty is above it all and over all;
in which we are well content, and are at peace and rest:
and this prison is to me as a palace of pleasure, for though we are as "`having nothing,
yet possessing all things`" through Him that has loved us, and gave Himself for us;
by whose blood we are ransomed,
to serve the Lord in the new covenant of life,--glory
be unto the Lord God Almighty forever!

And now, dear George, what they may be permitted to do further with us,
I do not yet know; though this I know, the rage of some is very great,
and they are bent to do wickedly.
They talk to us of the oath: but if they can find our horses,
I suppose they will take them, and send us out of the town; but if not,
I cannot tell (nor do I believe they are yet resolved) what they will do with us.
But, however, much is stirring in the minds of most people,
against their cruel and inhuman dealing with us, to put us so close,
in such a cold smokey place, at such a season of the year;
+++[+++first month by our reckoning;]
for they will not allow us to be in a room where a chimney is,
though it be not otherwise made use of, and lies void over our heads.
I hear that one of the magistrates of the town did
offer the Mayor to be bound body for body for us,
that we might be at some chamber in the town fit for men, but it would not be adopted:
but we are content, and well over it.

I desire you to salute me kindly in the Lord to Margaret
Fell and the rest of your fellow prisoners;
and in the love and peace of God,

[.signed-section-closing]
I remain yours to serve you,

[.salutation]
Dear George,

With true and unfeigned love do I heartily salute you;
dear and precious is the remembrance of you even to us all; and in our sufferings,
a few lines from you has made our hearts right glad.
Truly the rage of the wicked is not little in this place;
yet has the Lord so led us by his arm, that over it all we trample;
and Truth is over the heads of this ungodly generation.
We were in prison about fifty odd prisoners,
and now are brought this Sessions to our trial; about fifty upon the oath of allegiance;
and yet the jury cleared us.
But they had about fourteen of us again, and tendered the oath anew to us,
and sent us to prison: we had four more,
that (as they said) were in upon their third offence, and they were likewise cleared:
so that though the justices (so called) were (some of them) wicked,
yet the country set them +++[+++Friends]
free; and those bad men have sent them to prison again.
We are twenty-five in all, yet left.
This day our meeting was quiet, contrary to all our expectations.

Our little children kept the meetings up, when we were all in prison,
notwithstanding that wicked justice Armorer, when he came and found them there,
with a staff that he had with a spear in it,
would pull them out of the meeting and punch them in the back,
till some of them have been black in the face:
his fellow I believe is not to be found in England as a justice of the peace.
And now we are so close kept, that no man must speak with me,
but in the hearing of the jailer: yet the Lord supports us,
and we are over all in true peace and unity.
The bearer, my man, can give you a large account of things.^

Therefore sit under the shadow of the Almighty,

Appleby, fifth-day of this week, 1666.

[.salutation]
Margaret Fell,

Dear and well-beloved, whom I love in the Truth, and have ever so done since I knew it;
being very glad to hear of you, and from you, and of your well-being.
I received your last, since the court session at Lancaster,
which was acceptable unto me;--not forgetting the days of old, when we were comforted,
refreshed and rejoiced together in the Lord, when we were present personally together:
and being now absent outwardly, we know wherein our union with God stands,
and with all the saints in light.
I do indeed often rejoice in my heart, that God has prolonged my days so long,
to see so much of God`'s power and glory brought forth in our age.
I am freely given up; and I bless the Lord I am very well content,
I am in perfect joy and peace: I bless the Lord,
who has been our refuge and preservation until now.

Dear heart, I thought to have written unto you, when the Assize was done here;
but so many Friends were here, and I was, as it were,
encumbered with multitudes of people, and little room; and then,
that news of the desolation of London coming in the neck of it, hindered me:
and indeed people have been and are so mad and rude hereabouts,
I can hardly either receive a letter or write one.
I have so bad a jailer, who is very often the cause of detaining any stranger,
and getting them into bonds for his gain,
insomuch that I am sometimes more troubled for them than for myself.
Of late he will let none speak with me, though they come but out of Cumberland;
but I must bear all this, and much more, till God order it otherwise.

I am hearty glad of George Fox`'s liberty,
though these two years I have not written a line to him,
for fear of troubling him in his strait bonds.
I am satisfied of the righteous judgment of the Lord upon that great rebellious city;
and indeed I looked for great judgment to come some years since, and one woe came,
that great pestilence; but I feared they had forgotten it, as though it had not been;
hardness of heart and wickedness abounded, and behold,
God had determined utter desolation.
Oh! that all who yet remain, might go and inquire the cause, and consider and repent;
and cease striving against the Lord,
lest his hand be more and more stretched forth in judgment!
Yet I cannot but rejoice, that many people were not destroyed in so sad a calamity.
As for poor Friends, they have suffered many great evils and trials in it,
and were imprisoned and shamefully ill-treated by most, and by them in power;
and therefore, after many warnings, signs, and prophecies, God avenged himself of it;
that all flesh might bow before Him, and dread his powerful name.
And God that has preserved the lives of them that believe, will, I believe, sustain them,
and preserve them to his glory!

I am no more weary of bonds than the first day I came in;
yet if it be the will of God I desire liberty,
that I might behold the faces of dear Friends again, and be comforted in them,
that we might rejoice together in the Lord.
I had but one companion, and he has laid down the body this last week,--a good man;
he has suffered much, he was in for tithes, and made a sweet end.
My wife and children are well I hear, blessed be God.
Remember me dearly to all your children and fellow-prisoners and friends thereabouts;
and signify if you know where George Fox is now.
Not more, but that I am your truly loving friend and brother,
in the fellowship of the gospel of Christ,

[.salutation]
Dear Friends,

To whom is my love,
and to all the faithful who inquire after me.--The Lord God Almighty give you,
in his power, dominion; that in it you may all strive to be of one mind, heart, and soul;
keeping the unity in the one Spirit, which is the bond of peace;
and drinking all into the one Spirit,
by which you are circumcised and baptised into one body,
to one heavenly and spiritual Head.

And now Friends, several ships are going out to Jamaica and New York;
it would be well to send, or to see that books be sent there, or epistles.
And it would be well,
if some Friends did offer up themselves to the bishops and priests or magistrates,
for their brethren that be in prison,
to lie in prison a quarter of a year or a month or more or less,
that they might that time have their liberty;
so that our brethren may not perish in prison,
and so that the blood of the innocent may not come upon them,
and their souls cry for vengeance against them,
and so bring destruction upon them and others.
So I shall leave it to the Spirit of God in all Friends in every country; and you may,
as you pass up and down, inform Friends.

It would be well to prepare something of the sufferings of Friends,
against the sitting of the next Parliament, and concerning oaths,
and of Friends`' yes and no being taken;
but to gather a fuller account than they had the last Parliament, for it was very short.
And so dear William, +++[+++_perhaps Penn_]
you may read this in the Second-day`'s morning meeting;
and with my love to all Friends that inquire after me.

Keep your habitations in the seed of life and salvation;
that will outlast all that is out of it.
So with love,

London, 27th of 9th month, +++[+++11th month]
1676.

[.salutation]
Dear George Fox,

My dear and tender love is to you,
even that love which the God of my life shed abroad
in my heart in the dawning of the gospel day,
which is living and fresh in me at this time; in which I very dearly salute you,
with dear Margaret Fell and her daughters,
and all the rest of your family who love and live in the Truth.
My love in Christ reaches to every individual and
to all the Friends of Truth there and thereaway.

Dear George, having been long out of this city,
it is in my heart to give you a particular account of our labours and travels,
from our going out to our return to this city.
The 30th of the 6th month 1676, I with my companion George Whitehead,
left this city and came to Hammersmith, where we had a very precious meeting:
several Friends from London did accompany us there.
After the meeting we passed to Kingston, called at Robert Dring`'s by the way,
who took our visit very kindly.
I inquired for Friends`' letters and papers,
which were written in the beginning of the spreading of Truth, but could find none;
they being burnt in the firing of London, as Dorothy did say.
They inquired of you in much love.
On the 31st we had a large and open meeting at Kingston;
and God`'s presence did appear with us.
On the 1st day of the 7th month, being the sixth-day of the week,
accompanied by Gerrard Roberts we rode to Guildford,
where was a monthly meeting for men and women; and having notice of our coming,
it was the more large; and we had a good opportunity and service for God among them.

After the meeting we came to Stephen Smyth`'s, and stayed there on seventh-day,
and visited some Friends.
On first-day; we rode about 10 miles,
and came to a monthly meeting at Froile in Hampshire, which was large;
the meeting room would not contain the people, so we met in an orchard:
and God`'s holy and blessed presence did accompany us.
On second-day, we had a good meeting in Friends`' new meetinghouse at Alton.
On third-day, we rode about 15 miles, and came to Swanmore,
where was a quarterly meeting: Friends were in good order,
and carried on their business in love and unity:
we had a good opportunity among them to our satisfaction,
Friends being there from most meetings in the county;
and from them we had opportunity to send to Ringwood and Poole.
That night we lodged at George Ernbrie`'s in Southampton; and on fourth-day,
we had a solid weighty meeting: Ambrose Rigge was with us there.
On fifth-day morning early, we left Southton, and travelled 16 miles,
and came to Ringwood, where we had a good meeting: several Baptists and others came in,
and Truth did reach them: we had a meeting in the evening also.

On the sixth-day we came to Poole, and had a very open, fresh meeting.
On seventh-day, we travelled about 22 miles and came to Weymouth,
where on the first-day we had a large meeting;
Friends having notice came from several parts, and God`'s power and presence was with us.
On second-day also, we had a meeting there.
On third-day, we rode about 14 miles, and came to Bridport,
where we had a meeting in Friends`' hired place, where never any meeting had been;
and many people came, both professors and profane, and filled the room.
And after one of us began to declare, they were all very still, and gave attention;
and God`'s power bound and chained down the loose wild spirits, and we parted in peace;
we heard since that many did give a very good report of the meeting:
Friends were glad of the opportunity.
After the meeting we rode 16 miles; we were two hours within night,
and came to Membury where we found old Jean Pollexfen,
who had lain there 10 weeks by a fall from her horse;--poor woman,
she was in some distress of mind, being a prisoner, and not knowing how to get to Exeter;
but since, she is gotten to her prison chamber, which is great satisfaction to her mind,
though she continues lame.

On the fourth-day, we had a good meeting at Friends`' meetinghouse near Membry.
On the fifth-day, we came to Topsham about 22 miles,
and at Friends`' weekly meeting there, and had a fresh, awakening time;
but the meeting being small, we appointed another meeting there on the sixth-day,
where were Friends from Exeter and out of the country,
and the Lord`'s presence was with us.
On the seventh-day, we rode through Totness, and came to Kingsbridge,
and lodged at honest William Hingston`'s. On first-day,
we had a good meeting at their meetinghouse near Kingsbridge;
several strangers were there, and we had a blessed meeting.
On third-day, we came to Plymouth,
and on the fourth-day we had a large and blessed
meeting in the Friends new meeting place,
which is large and very convenient;
and the people of that town have an ear open to Truth: we stayed on fifth-day,
and on sixth-day we had another heavenly and blessed meeting.
And seeing such an openness, Friends were very urgent for a first-day meeting;
so George Whitehead finding a freedom from the Lord stayed on first-day,
and we had a very large and precious meeting,
and in the evening also a meeting of some Friends.

I passed over into Cornwall, and had a very full meeting at Thomas Deeble`'s house;
and the Lord did open my heart in much love and tenderness among them.
On the second-day, I visited some Friends in Liscard, and so came to Thomas Mounce`'s;
where on the third-day we had a very great meeting, and God`'s blessed power was with us:
old Thomas is very hearty, and glad of our visit.
On the fourth-day we came through Bodenham +++[+++Bodmin (?)]
and visited the prisoners there, being five on Truth`'s account,
most for non-payment of tithes.
Afterwards we came to Austle,
where we were kindly entertained at Thomas Salthouse`'s. On the fifth-day,
we came to Loveday Hambly`'s where we had a good meeting.

We rested on sixth-day and on seventh-day,
George Whitehead and Thomas Salthouse rode to Truro,
and had a very good and serviceable meeting in their new meetinghouse,
and parted in peace.
I stayed at Loveday Hambly`'s, and had a large meeting;
many strangers came in and were tender, and God`'s heavenly presence did accompany us.
Poor old Loveday was even overcome,
and gladdened in her heart to see her house (which she had lately enlarged,) so filled:
she has a zeal for God, and loves the prosperity of Truth.
On second-day early, I called on George Whitehead at Truro,
and that evening we came to Market Jew, +++[+++Marazion,]
where on the third-day we had a very sweet and heavenly meeting, though not very large:
after the meeting we rode to Jo. Ellis`'s house,
where on the fourth-day we had a powerful meeting,--many of the eminent +++[+++_or different_]
professors were there, and confessed to Truth;
and Friends were refreshed and comforted in our visit.
After the meeting, we came to Captain Whiddon`'s, near Penzance,
who very lovingly received us.
On the fifth-day, we travelled to Fallmouth,
where that evening we had a meeting at Jo. Scantlebury`'s house.
On sixth-day, we had a meeting at the meetinghouse in the country near Perin;
and the Lord`'s presence did crown our assembly.

After the meeting, we came to Truro, and lodged at Edward Hinks +++[+++?]
an old disciple and faithful servant of God.
On seventh-day, we called at Penzance, Thomas Lower`'s house;
his servants have looked long for him there: afterwards we came to Loveday Hambly`'s,
where on the first-day we had a very large, blessed, and heavenly meeting;
the house would not contain the people, but several were without;
and the Lord`'s power was manifest, and virtue went out;
in due time we hope the effect will show itself: the priests`' congregations were thin,
and some said if we stayed awhile,
they thought we should have most of the people of two parishes.
We rested on the second-day,
George Whitehead having sprained his foot and on the third-day,
we crossed the country to the north sea to Penvos, a farm belonging to Laurence Growdon,
where we lodged, L. G. being with us.

On the fourth-day, we passed through Padstow, and crossed the river,
and came to a meeting at Minver, where we had good service for the Lord.
After the meeting, I came to Humphrey Lower`'s,
where I was very kindly and lovingly entertained;
but none of the family came to the meeting but poor honest Jo. Bray.
On fifth-day morning, I called at Jo. Billings`' and spoke to him and his wife,
who both confessed to Truth, but the way is too strait for them to walk in.
I met George Whitehead at Camelford, who came from Abram Rowe`'s,
and so we came to Launceston; we had a very wet day, and got some cold.
Arthur Cotton travelled with us through Cornwall:
that evening we had a fresh but little meeting at Jo. Kerton`'s +++[+++?]
house: there are a few in that town that hold the testimony of Truth.

On the sixth-day early, we left Launceston,
and came to Oakhampton and so to North Tawton,
where we had a very fresh and open meeting; many of the townspeople came in,
and were very tender, and confessed to the Truth.
On the sixth-day, we came to Exeter, and visited Joan Poulton,
and the rest of the prisoners; and afterwards we came to Collumpton,
where on the first-day we had a large and precious meeting.
On the second-day, we came to +++_______+++ton,^
footnote:[Perhaps Taunton.
John Alloway was of Wivelscomb--[.book-title]#Whiting`'s Memoirs.#]
and on the third-day we had a large meeting at John Allawaye`'s. On the fourth-day,
we crossed the country, and came to Chard, where we had some service in the evening.
On fifth-day, we had a meeting at Illminster; and on sixth-day at Crewkerne;
and God`'s blessed power and presence was with us.
After the meeting we came to Illchester; and on seventh-day,
we had good opportunities with the prisoners in the forenoon in the ward,
where four or five are upon execution; and in the afternoon in the Friars +++[+++?]
where John Anderton^

not only in prison, but other places abroad.

is prisoner, with several other honest Friends.
That evening we came to Puddimore, where on the first-day we had a large, blessed,
and heavenly meeting; there were Friends from above twenty meetings, as some did reckon.
On the second-day, we came to Shapton Mallet; and on third-day,
we had a fresh and good meeting at Abram Clothier`'s.

On fourth-day, we came to Hollowtrow, and had a meeting at their meeting-place:
we lodged at Jo. Dando`'s. On fifth-day, we came to Cainsham,
and had a heavenly meeting there, where we met several Bristol Friends: that evening,
we came to Bristol, and lodged at Thomas Jordan`'s, who lives in old Den`'s house.
On sixth-day, we had a meeting at the Fryars, and the Lord was with us;
also on the first-day in the morning at Temple Street,
and in the afternoon in the new meeting in the Fryars.
There is a great body of people in that city,
and it is great pity that any hurt should come upon them.
We laboured in all faithfulness among them, and the Lord was with us;
and where we met with any opposition, we repelled it in the name of the Lord:
we had a good meeting in the evening at our lodging.

On the second-day, we visited several Friends,
and in the afternoon we were at the women`'s meeting,
which was somewhat larger than usual, because of our being there.
On third-day, we had a good meeting among Friends, in the great meetinghouse;
on fourth-day at Frenchay; and on fifth-day at Olveston,
to the great refreshment and satisfaction of Friends and others.
We lodged at William Rogers`',^

though in much straitness, but in Truth`'s dominion we stood.
John Story came out of Wiltshire,
and George Whitehead had much discourse with him and William Rogers,
about many things too tedious to mention in this short relation:
in the evening William Rogers was moderate, and John Story high and rough;
but in the morning John Story was very calm, and William Rogers in a storm,
not to me but to George Whitehead: we cleared our consciences to both of them,
and left them.

That day being sixth-day, we came again to Bristol, and had a good meeting in the Friars.
On seventh-day we visited several, who have let in a sour leaven to their hurt;
we cleared our consciences and left them.
On first-day, we were at both meetings;
and God`'s blessed power and heavenly dominion was with us:
+++[+++_part torn off_].--We came to Alesbury but finding few Friends in the town,
we came on to Isaac Penington`'s--at a meeting at Thomas Law`'s
where was a marriage,--the meeting was--+++[+++the Lord`'s presence (?)]
was in the midst of us: I may truly say, I have seldom been at such a marriage,
and--more of God`'s presence to my remembrance; to God alone be glory,
etc.--+++[+++_parts lost._]
On the sixth-day, being the 14th of the 9th month, we came to London,
where we found our wives and families well;
for which our souls do magnify and bless the name of God.

Thus, dear George, I have given you a brief account of our travails in this our journey.
In this city things are well, and our meetings full and quiet.
Glad would many be to hear of your motion this way,
which would dash and give the lie to many bad spirits,
who have prophesied of your downfall; and be a great comfort to the upright in heart.
George Whitehead with several of the brethren dearly and tenderly salute you: so with my,
and my wife`'s, dear love to you, and to all in your family,
I rest yours in the unchangeable love of Truth.

Dear Sarah Fell,

Some days ago I received both your letters, by William Taylor.
I return you this answer, chiefly to try an expedient,
whether letters put in at the post-office at Edinburgh, will come safe to your hands;
for which end I order this that way; and if you receive it,
let me have by the first post an answer,
directing it for me to be left with David Falconer, merchant,
in Edinbro`'. I will not enlarge by this, because uncertain of its safe conversance.
I have been a prisoner since I left your sister, but was kept only two nights.
Patrick Livingstone, has been out and in again.
George Keith and Thomas Mercer were taken a week ago this day.

From Holland I had last night a letter that gave me much satisfaction,
in which was one enclosed from Herwarden from Anna Van Horne to Lillian Skeine,
very loving; and a short postscript from Elizabeth +++[+++the Princess (?)]
in these words:--"`Dear friend,
I love your upright intention to travail in spirit for your friends,
though unknown to you; and doubt not but it will prove efficacious to them,
in the Lord`'s due time; which is the wish of your loving friend,
Elizabeth.`"--I refer other matters to a further occasion.

My entire love to your father and mother, to Isabel my dear fellow traveller,
to Susan and Rachel, as also your brother and sister Lower,
with Leonard and others of my acquaintance.
You will excuse this briefness at this time to your very affectionate friend,

[.salutation]
Dear George Fox,

To whom is my dear and unfeigned love in the unchangeable Truth,
of whom to hear is always refreshful unto me.
I know it will be acceptable to you to understand,
that at last the tedious persecution at Aberdeen seems to have come to an end;
for Friends have had their meetings peaceable near these two months,
and dear P. L. +++[+++Patrick Livingstone (?)]
after having had several peaceable meetings,
is now come away a noble conqueror from that place,
and is gone to visit Friends in the west country,
and then intends homeward by way of Newcastle.
I doubt not, but that God will abundantly reward his courage and patience;
for his stay has been of great service to Truth and Friends in these parts.
I came here at the earnest desire of W. P. +++[+++William Penn (?)]
and other Friends, to speak to the D. of York concerning the New Jersey business;
but fear there will be little effectual got done in it.
I doubt it has been spoiled in the managing at first.

Friends here are generally well, as George Keith and his wife, H. P., R. R. and others;
and their love I know is to you.
I should be very glad, if your freedom could allow of it,
to see you in this country in the spring: I know it would be of great service,
for there are several things that would need it: several things go cross,
and are so now in various places;
and I know no man`'s presence could so easily remedy it as yours.
I heard from Holland lately, where Friends are well;
but the brothers of the deceased Simon Tonson of Rotterdam,
are about to pursue his widow for his estate, as not being legally married to her;
but it is hoped they will not carry it, and their judgment is,
that it will be of great consequence to Friends hereafter, as to their marriages.^
footnote:[From some correspondence which took place in 1683,
between Friends in Holland and Stephen Crisp, also with the Morning Meeting in London,
it appears the widow`'s case was then undecided;
and that some proceedings were on foot with the government of Holland,
for legalizing the marriages of Friends,
on their agreeing to give notice to the civil magistrate before the marriage,
as well as afterwards of its solemnization.
Some of the Friends of Holland scrupled as to the previous notice;
and the advice of the Morning Meeting was requested.
The answer was to this effect:
that "`it was not inconsistent with Truth`'s testimony,`"
to certify the magistrate both before and after the marriage,
"`all things having first passed with clearness through the meetings
of Friends;`" that "`if the like were offered here,
and to exempt and clear Friend`'s marriages from the penal laws,
Friends believe it would be accepted by Friends generally.`"
"`We have been willing from the beginning,
(writes George Whitehead on this occasion,) that
our marriages should be made known to the magistrates,
and published at market crosses, etc.,
as George Fox says.`"--The Morning Meeting further remarks,--For
though we cannot allow the right of marrying to the civil magistrate,
"`yet his right to take cognizance of offenders, covenant breakers, etc.
(which are but a scandal to Truth and us,) as well as to punish adulterers,
etc.,--magistrates being set to be a terror to evil workers,
and for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well,
and to defend them in their rights and properties,--has always been our testimony.
Therefore, Friends being free to impart the simple knowledge of their intentions,
will rather bespeak their innocency and clearness from all violations of contracts,
clandestine proceedings, etc., than the refusal of such notice;
and surely we would have our innocency appear both before marriage and after.`"
These remarks are interesting,
as being applicable to the course adopted by Friends in this country,
on the late change in our marriage laws, before this correspondence turned up.]
My dear and entire love is to Margaret and all the family; and in the love,
of the unchangeable Truth, I continue

Francis Howgill to Margaret Fell

[.signed-section-context-open]
Dublin, 30th of 7th month, +++[+++9th month]
1655.

[.salutation]
Dear Margaret Fell,

After we parted from you at Swarthmore, we passed down to Warrington that first-day;
and there was an exceedingly great meeting.
From Ormskirk and near Liverpool, many came:
but we were pressed to go on and make no stay; and so came to Chester,
and visited the prisoners, and stayed in town all night.
On the next day we came to the sea,
but the wind was contrary.--When they sailed the wind blew softly,
and so we were two days and two nights on the sea.
On the fourth-day of the week, we came to Dublin; and on the fifth,
we had a meeting at one Captain Rich`'s; and on the first-day,
at one Captain Alan`'s house; many people came, and all calm.
They (the Captains) are loving, but there is not much in them.

Edward Burrough went up to the deputive house, where was a meeting of Baptists;
he has been there three times, and spoke with Fleetwood himself, who was moderate,
much like Oliver Cromwell: but the officers have bowed down to the idol baptism,
for promotion; for it grew in great fashion a while here, but now it withers.
We have been here about three weeks, and we have pretty good meetings on the first-day:
but they are a careless, dissolute, proud people.
Edward Burrough went up to the Phoenix, and I stayed at the meeting;
it was pretty large and calm, and there are good desires in many.
But now, my beloved yokefellow and I must part,
who have borne the yoke so long together:--the cross is great,
in so strange and barbarous a nation; yet it is not so great,
as if any other had parted us: in the will of God we are.

I am moved to go a hundred miles west in the nation towards Cork; there is a service,
and a people to be gathered, that way; and at Kingsale, and Bandon bridge,
at the end of the land.
Edward Burrough must stay here: for this city we cannot leave yet;
but I am given up to lay down all for Him, who has made me a conqueror;
glory unto Him forevermore!
Salute me in the Lord to all your children, and all the church there-aways;
and as you are free, write a word to my wife.
So the everlasting arm of God preserve us in his power: and that, if it be his will,
we may see one another`'s faces; that we may praise the Lord together.

Your dear brother in the unchangeable life of God,

+++[+++Dublin (?)]
1655.

My dearly beloved sister, in whom my soul is refreshed by the remembrance of you.
I dearly salute you in the fountain of life, at which I do drink with you,
and am daily nourished and refreshed.
But with heaviness of spirit I write unto you, yes, and with my eyes full of tears;
for I am separated outwardly from my dear beloved brother, Francis Howgill,
who was my right-hand man in the war, before whom many Philistines have fallen.
And truly when I consider what the Lord has done by us, my heart is rent and broken;
many glorious days we enjoyed, and many pleasant hours we had together,
in dividing the spoil of our enemy; for our hand was always strong in battle,
and our ensign was lifted up above our enemies,
and even thousands have fallen on our right hand and on our left.

But according to the will of God we are now separated, he into the west of this nation,
100 or six score miles from Dublin; where I must stay a season,
for all I do see,--and truly under great suffering,
for few here are that hunger after God, and blindness and deafness has possessed all.
Little Elizabeth Fletcher is at present here, but I know not how long she stays;
her dear love is to you and to all the flock of God.
Truly I suffer for her, she being as it were alone,
having no other woman with her in this +++[+++ruinous or ravenous (?)]
nation, where it is very bad travelling,--every way a foot, and also dangerous;
but we are much above all that.
If it were the will of the Lord that any women were moved to come over to her,
it might be serviceable.
I was glad that Francis Howgill had so good an opportunity of passing on his journey;
he went with a cornet and some others, who were very loving to us,
and came to meetings while they stayed in the city.

To all the family, and to the dear flock of God there away, salute us.
We have not had any letter from you in the north, nor from London, since we came;
we have written to London, but have had no return; here is a post weekly,
if the wind lie not wholly contrary.
Let your prayers be to the everlasting Father for us,
that his dread may go along with us, over all.
Our parting was a heavy burden upon us both, especially in this strange nation;
but we saw it to be of God, and we bore the cross of it.
As you can at opportunity, write to us, it will make me glad:
one face of a Friend would rejoice my soul.
Gladly would I hear of George Fox and James Nayler, and of the rest in the south,
where I know the work of the Lord is glorious; and though some do rejoice,
yet truly at present we are men of sorrows,
but resting in the will of our heavenly Father.

+++[+++Waterford,]
5th of 11th month, 1655, +++[+++1st month]
1656.

Sister beloved, whom I forget not, but do remember with kindness,
and of whom I am not forgotten; with my heart and soul, I do salute you,
being bound up with you in the covenant of life everlasting.
We are joint heirs of the incorruptible inheritance in the Son,
who in us lives and works of his own will; in whom we are what we are,
and by whom we do what is done; to Him we give his own, glorifying him with his own,
world without end.

Though far distant from one another,
yet my love is hereby increased unto all the children of light;
with tears rejoicing in the unity of the Spirit with you all,--who am
to you a brother and companion in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ,
and in labours and travels and sufferings more abundant:
but as in suffering with Christ I do abound,
so my joy by him and consolation in him are increased also.

Only two letters have I received from you since I came out of England:
I am now at Waterford city, where an honest people is gathering into the fold.
Two weeks was I in Dublin city, in the ministry of Christ,
labouring in season and out of season; and my suffering was not little in that place,
and I had none to bear the yoke with me in my travails; and yet I was not alone,
but the Father was with me in power and wisdom and boldness.
It is a bad place, +++[+++Dublin,]
a very refuge for the wicked: being moved I passed through it to this place,
for our service lies only in great towns and cities;
for generally the country is without inhabitant,
except bands of murderers and thieves and robbers, which wait for their prey,
and devour many; from which yet we are preserved.

I had great opposition in this city; five times opposed by the rulers, who are Baptists,
and once was I tried for a vagabond, and once examined by them for a Jesuit:
but to this day, out of snares and plots am I preserved,
and walk as a bird among fowler`'s snares, and as an innocent dove which has no mate,
no,--none unto whom I can open my cause, but the Lord my God only.
About sixteen days was I at Kilkenny city, twenty miles from this;
where I gave a warning to the inhabitants, and was twice among the Baptists;
and one time by command from the governor of the city,
was I haled out of their assembly rudely, in the manner of their generation;
but a few in that city received our report.

I have not long heard from my chiefest companion Francis Howgill,
whose love in the same measure salutes you with mine.
It is now four months since we parted at Dublin,
and what I have said in respect of sufferings and trials, he can seal the same with me;
who have been companions in tribulation and in patience,
and are now in joy and rejoicing; hoping to receive the end of our labour,
and to see the travail of our souls, that we may bring in the +++[+++sheep (?)]
with us into the fold, and may return to our camp with victory from our Lord.
And we have not spared to wound on the right hand and on the left; and victory, victory,
has been our word of watch.
And though this nation be as the heath in the desert, yet there is a seed and a remnant,
for whose sake we are sent.
Seldom have I heard from him +++[+++Francis Howgill]
since; but he is about Cork and Kinsale and Bandon,
sixty or eighty miles from this place; and he has written for me to come that way,
if I had freedom, for there was service.
But yet I have not had freedom to leave these parts,
for here is a harvest and but few labourers; and a war is begun in this nation,
and but very few on our part to manage it.

Our dear sisters Elizabeth Fletcher and E. Smith are also in the west,
valiant for the Truth; and some from London arrived at Dublin,
who are gone into the north of this nation.
Of all our work and labour, which is doubled upon us since we parted,
have we a reward into our bosoms; and herein will our joy be more enlarged,
to hear how the war prospers in that nation +++[+++England]: write and let us know,
that we may partake with you in your rejoicing;
and assuredly you may praise the living God on our behalf.
Here is great deficiency of books in this nation,
which might be very serviceable in spreading forth the Truth.
Now I leave it to you, my dear sister, what way you see best,
that some books might be sent to this land: thus much was upon me to mind you in general,
with my dear love.
I desire to be saluted to all the children of light, etc.

one Cornet Cook and his wife, the most eminent house in the town,

embraced the Truth with his whole heart;

Since I wrote,
a company of priests have gone up and procured a warrant or an order from Dublin,
and sent it to the governor of Kingsale, and another to Colonel Phayre, governor of Cork;
and they sent down several questions to ask me.
The order was general, to take up all Quakers, and send them to Dublin,
which is 120 miles off; I was at Kingsale, at one of the governor`'s houses,
when it came:
and the governor of Cork sent a letter privately
for me to come there.--I am at this city at present:
but none I think will meddle, unto whom the commission was sent.
Major Stoding is turned out of the commission of the peace upon this account;
and it is like they will do so with Colonel Phayre: but he is noble, and says,
more is done by the Quakers,
than all the priests in the country have done a hundred years.
And now many are moved daily to bear witness against the priests:
the work of the Lord is great,--glory to Him forever!

Elizabeth Fletcher is here.--Edward Burrough I have not heard of these six weeks.
I hear they imprison all at Dublin.

[.salutation]
Dearly Beloved,

It is now three weeks and some days since we were taken prisoners in the city of Cork,
by the High Sheriff of the county, by order of the Council and chief ruler in Ireland:
it was dated at Dublin,
expressly for us two to be brought by some guards
and convoys before the Council at Dublin;
which was done accordingly.
Great service we had in our journey, about 130 miles.
We came prisoners to Dublin,
and were severally examined before Henry Cromwell and his Council,
but nothing charged against us, and only vain questions propounded;
and mighty was the power of the Lord with us to the confounding of our enemies.
That night we were committed to prison at the Sergeant-at-Arms his house;
where we had a large chamber, and none was hindered to come to us.

We sent forth many papers, and gave a haling to all the priests in the city,
to give us a public meeting, but they answered us not.
Six days we were in prison there,
till the Council made an order to the mayor of the city,
that he should with speed send us for England; which was done accordingly,
to the grief of our spirits; who were to be so far separated from the dear babes,
which are begotten in that nation, unto whom our souls wish grace and love.
The 2nd of this month we arrived at Chester, where we stayed one night,
and heard of a meeting at Preston, to which we made haste, much desiring to be there;
which also was brought to pass by the hand of our God.
The meeting was to the great advantage of Truth; and contrary to expectation or thought,
John Audland, Alexander Parker and we, were brought together.
We are now going into the north.

Truly great service for the Lord we had in Ireland for near seven months;
the particulars would be very large; but in short, there is a precious work begun,
and a seed sown, which shall never die.
More largely at another time shall I write, but thus much in haste.
Truly shall we stand in the counsel of our God, to be +++[+++--__word not clear__]
in his service, which we are wholly given up to do.
Francis Howgill`'s dear wife, we hear, is departed this world,
which will be a little hinderance to him at present,
as to settle his children and the like;
but truly he is wholly given up to do our Father`'s will,
through great and many trials and dangers and sufferings.

[.salutation]
Dear and Most Honourable,

Yours with much joy I received; and things here are at present pretty cool.
I am now in the north, where all is quiet and still, and meetings enlarge daily.
I came lately out of the west, from Cork, Bandon, Limerick, and those parts,
where persecution has been greater since these changes +++[+++_political_ (?)];
prisons daily attending us, haling out of their towns, and breaking meetings,
and blows and threats, and many other sufferings Friends have sustained by them.
Whole meetings have been carried to prison in several places;
at Limerick they have kept Friends near four weeks together,
and at Dublin the greatest part of a quarter of a year,
and at Cork they have several times done the same:
I was there a little while since at a monthly meeting,
and near the end of our meeting they came with a guard of soldiers,
and carried away all the men Friends to prison.
And so about Waterford they have done the same, and almost in all parts of the nation;
many sharp trials Friends have had by them.

Things are generally well with Friends, and meetings fresh and living;
a blessed presence is among them, and they are well got over their sufferings,
and in wisdom have been well preserved in their several meetings.
I do believe many of them are freely given up to suffer all things for the Truth`'s sake.
Here is some increase lately,
several are convinced since these revolutions +++[+++in government (?)]:
about the middle of the nation there is a meeting of near forty,
and most convinced lately; at this time things are a little quieter,
I know of none in prison but what are in for tithes.
As to my own particular, dear George Fox, I am well;
and the Lord`'s blessing and pure presence are with me in my labours.
It is yet on me to stay in this nation,
and the thing has often run through me--you must
travel through this storm with Friends here.
I am truly and wholly given up into the will of God,
and am content to suffer and endure all things for the Lord`'s sake.
Abundance of threats in various places are uttered against me,
and they have had me in prison several times;
but way has been made for my release in some short time.

footnote:[This Friend,
who has been called "`the apostle of Ireland,`" from
his early and zealous labours in that land,
"`was a man of an excellent gift, sound, clear, and powerful in his ministry,
elegant in speech, sharp and quick in his understanding;
and his testimony was very convincing.
It was through his ministry that William Penn became convinced:
William Penn having a considerable estate of his
father`'s in Ireland committed to his care,
which occasioned his coming to the country;
and being informed that Thomas Loe was to be at a meeting in Cork, he went to meet him.
Thomas Loe began his declaration with these memorable words:
'`There is a faith that overcomes the world,
and there is a faith that is overcome by the world:`' upon
which subject he enlarged with great clearness and energy;
and by the living and powerful testimony of this man,
(which had made some impression upon William Penn`'s
spirit ten years before,) he was now thoroughly convinced;
and afterwards constantly attended the meetings of the people called Quakers,
even through the heat of persecution.`"--Rutty`'s [.book-title]#History of Friends in Ireland,# p. 112.
Thomas Loe died in London, (as our Register states,) "`the 6th of 8th month 1668,
